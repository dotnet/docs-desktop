![Markdownlint](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-desktop/workflows/Markdownlint/badge.svg) [![target supported version](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-desktop/actions/workflows/version-sweep.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-desktop/actions/workflows/version-sweep.yml)

This repository contains the conceptual documentation for .NET desktop technologies, such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms (WinForms). It's published at the [.NET Desktop Guide documentation site](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/desktop).

## Issues

We have a large community using these resources. We make our best effort to respond to issues in a timely fashion. You can read more about our procedures for classifying and resolving issues in our [Issues policy](issues-policy.md) topic.

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET docs. This is a very large repo, covering a large area. If this is your first visit, see our [labels and projects roadmap](styleguide/labels-projects.md) for help navigating the issues and projects in this repository.

## Migrate old examples

If you're interested in helping migrate existing code that targets the .NET Framework (specifically WPF and WinForms) from the [retired Code Gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/teamblog/msdn-code-gallery-retired) site to .NET Core applications stored in our [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) and downloadable from the [Samples Browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/samples/browse), see the [Code Gallery migration](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/88) project. The code gallery samples were moved to the [Microsoft Archive](https://github.com/microsoftarchive?q=msdn-code-gallery) organization.
