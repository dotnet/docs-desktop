# Quickstart: [verb] * [noun]
 
<!-- Required: Article headline - H1

Identify the product or service and the feature area
the quickstart covers.

-->

[Introduce and explain the purpose of the article.]

<!-- Required: Introductory paragraphs (no heading)

Write a brief introduction that can help the user determine 
whether the article is relevant for them. Begin with a 
sentence that says, "In this quickstart, you . . . ."

-->

If you don't have a service subscription, create a free
trial account . . .

<!-- Required: Free account links (no heading)

Because quickstarts are intended to help new customers
use a product or service, include a link to a 
free trial before the first H2 or in the prerequisites.

-->

## Prerequisites

<!-- Optional: Prerequisites - H2

If included, "Prerequisites" must be the first H2 in the article.

List any items that are needed for the quickstart,
such as permissions or software.

If the user needs to sign in to a portal to do
the quickstart, provide instructions and a link.

-->

## Open [Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or PowerShell]

<!-- Optional: Open a demo environment - H2

If you want to refer to using Azure Cloud Shell,
the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, include the
instructions as a first step, after the "Prerequisites" section if prerequisites are included.

Include information about Cloud Shell only if all commands can 
run in Cloud Shell.

Use include files if they are available.

-->

## [verb] * [noun]

[Introduce a task and its role in completing the process.]

<!-- Required: Tasks to complete in the process - H2

In one or more numbered H2 sections, describe tasks that 
the user completes in the process the quickstart describes.

-->

1. Procedure step
1. Procedure step
1. Procedure step

<!-- Required: Steps to complete the tasks - H2

Use ordered lists to describe how to complete tasks in 
the process. Be consistent when you describe how to
use a method or tool to complete the task.

Code requires specific formatting. Here are a few useful 
examples of commonly used code blocks. Make sure to 
use the interactive functionality when possible.

For the CLI-based or PowerShell-based procedures,
don't use bullets or numbering.

Here is an example of a code block for Java:

```java
cluster = Cluster.build(new File("src/site.yaml")).create();
...
client = cluster.connect();
```

Here's a code block for the Azure CLI:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM 
--image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser 
--admin-password <password>
```

This is a code block for Azure PowerShell:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmContainerGroup -ResourceGroupName 
myResourceGroup -Name mycontainer 
-Image mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:nanoserver 
-OsType Windows -IpAddressType Public
```
-->

## Clean up resources

<!-- Optional: Steps to clean up resources - H2

Provide steps the user takes to clean up resources that
were created to complete the article.

-->

## Next step -or- Related content

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Next sequential article title](link.md)

-or-

- [Related article title](link.md)
- [Related article title](link.md)
- [Related article title](link.md)

<!-- Optional: Next step or Related content - H2

Consider adding one of these H2 sections (not both):

A "Next step" section that uses 1 link in a blue box 
to point to a next, consecutive article in a sequence.

-or- 

If the quickstart is not part of a sequence, use a 
"Related content" section that lists links to 
1 to 3 articles the user might find helpful.
