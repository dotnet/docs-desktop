# Demonstration: [verb] * [capability] * [product or service] * [scenario]

<!-- Required: Article headline - H1

Identify the product or service, the capability, and the 
problem solution that the demonstration illustrates.

-->

[Introduce and explain the purpose of the article.]

<!-- Required: Introductory paragraphs (no heading)

Write a brief introduction that can help the user determine 
whether the article is relevant for them. In the opening
sentence, focus on the product capability that will
be demonstrated.

-->

If you don't have a service subscription, create a free
trial account . . .

<!-- Required: Free account links (no heading)

Because demonstrations are intended to help new customers
evaluate a product or service, include a link to a 
free trial before the first H2.

-->

## Prerequisites

<!-- Required: Prerequisites - H2

"Prerequisites" must be the first H2 in the article.

List any items that are needed for the demonstration,
such as permissions or software.

If the user needs to sign in to a portal to complete
the demonstration, provide instructions and a link.

If there aren't any prerequisites, in a new paragraph
under the "Prerequisites" H2, enter "None" in plain text
(not as a bulleted list item).

-->

## Open [Cloud Shell, Azure CLI, or PowerShell]

<!-- Optional: Open a demo environment - H2

If you want to refer to using Azure Cloud Shell,
the Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell, place the
instructions after the "Prerequisites" section.

Include Cloud Shell only if all commands can 
run in Cloud Shell.

Use include file if they are available.

--->

## [Demonstrate a solution to a problem]

<!-- Required: Demonstration steps - H2

Use multiple H2 sections to guide the customer 
through an end-to-end demonstration.

-->

## What problem will we solve?

<!-- Required: Problem definition - H2

Clearly define the problem that the demonstration 
that follows will address and solve.

-->

## [Demonstration]

[Introduce the demonstration.]

<!-- Required: Demonstration that shows how to solve the problem - H2

In one or more H2 sections, show how the product or 
service solves a user's problem. For example, you
can run an app that implements the solution, you can 
embed a video that describes the solution, or you 
can add a series of images that demonstrate the key 
steps.

-->

## Clean up resources

<!-- Required: Steps to clean up resources - H2

Provide steps the user takes to clean up resources that
were created to complete the article.

-->

## Next step -or- Related content

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Next sequential article title](link.md)

-or-

- [Related article title](link.md)
- [Related article title](link.md)
- [Related article title](link.md)

<!-- Optional: Next step or Related content - H2

Consider adding one of these H2 sections (not both):

A "Next step" section that uses 1 link in a blue box 
to point to a next, consecutive article in a sequence.

-or- 

If the demonstration isn't part of a sequence, use a 
"Related content" section that lists links to 
1 to 3 articles the user might find helpful.
