This template provides the basic structure of an SDK overview article pattern. See the
[instructions -  SDK overview](../level4/article-sdk-overview.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

An SDK overview article is the entry point for the reader to use the SDK. It can include
the following information:

- Supported languages
- Prerequisites
- Download and install instructions
- Source code
- Samples
- Release notes

An SDK can include several libraries. Each library usually has a README file as part of
its repository. Be sure to include only the information for the SDK as a whole in
this overview.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Identify the product that this SDK works with. Indicate that this is an
SDK overview. For instance: [product] SDK.

-->

# [product] SDK [or] [product] SDK overview
TODO: Add your heading.

<!-- 2. Introduction --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required.

A short paragraph that identifies the product and the SDK a product is acceptable.

You can also explain what the SDK allows the customer to do with the product and include
notes or tips about the product. If this SDK overview article is long, you can provide
links to later sections or a summary of the content.

-->

[Your introduction]
TODO: Add your introduction.

<!-- 3. H2 sections ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional, but every article should have at least one H2 section. 

Some common sections are:

- Supported languages. Include a table with languages for different features of the SDK.
  If the SDK is organized as libraries with the language as part of the title, consider
  skipping this section.
- Prerequisites. 
- Download and install instructions. Don't repeat information available in 
  library-specific READMEs.
- Source code.
- Samples. Link to sample projects.
- Release notes.

-->

## [H2 new features sections]
TODO: Add H2 sections for features.

<!-- 4. Next steps ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Required. Include links that might be useful or interesting to the customer.

There's no firm number of links, but try to keep it to one to three obvious resources
for the reader. Too many might pull the reader off to irrelevant tasks.

Introduce the list with a short sentence. 

Installation links, quickstart guides, and tutorials might be useful.

## Next steps
TODO: Add links.
