Goal:
The control documentation for WPF is very out-of-date. Most articles show Windows XP screenshots
of the controls

I had AI look at the controls section of the TOC, which lists all of these controls, and then build me
a list of each control covered by this reference material

I then fed that list into another AI and told it to genereate me a WPF testing app that could list all of
these controls on the left, along with a display section on the right, so that I could capture new
screenshots.

After a little bit of iteration on the content, I was able to get the app designed to my liking.
