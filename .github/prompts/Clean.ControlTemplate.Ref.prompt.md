You are tasked with cleaning up and reorganizing WPF control reference articles in the `dotnet-desktop-guide/wpf/controls/` directory to ensure consistent structure and improved documentation quality.

**ALWAYS** write content according to `.github/instructions/Markdown.WritingStyle.instructions.md`

## Primary Tasks

### 1. Consolidate Reference Sections
Merge all scattered reference sections into a single `## See also` section at the end of the article:
- Combine content from: "See also", "Related sections", "Related articles", "Related topics", "Related links", "Reference", and similar sections
- Remove duplicate links and organize alphabetically
- Use proper link formatting with descriptive text

### 2. Remove Navigation Sections
Delete "In this section" or "In this article" sections entirely as they're auto-generated by the TOC.

### 3. Merge Overview Articles
When both `controlname.md` and `controlname-overview.md` exist:
- Merge the overview content into the main control article (`controlname.md`)
- Preserve ALL unique content from both articles
- Replace brief content with comprehensive overview content
- Delete the separate overview file after merging
- Update any internal links that referenced the overview file

### 4. Standardize Image Syntax
Convert all control images to modern markdown syntax:
```markdown
:::image type="content" source="./media/filename.png" alt-text="Descriptive alt text":::
```
- Ensure alt-text is descriptive and helpful for screen readers
- Use relative paths starting with `./media/`

### 5. Organize Content Structure
Arrange article content in this specific order:
1. **Introductory area** - This includes all of the following as part of the introduction, not as separate sections:
   - Brief description of the control and its purpose
   - Control image (if present) - Visual representation using modern image syntax
   - Related articles table (if applicable) - Table with "Title" and "Description" columns for control-specific how-to articles. Don't put them in a section, just add them under the intro
2. **Styles and templates** - XAML styling information. Cross reference `.github/projects/xaml/control-reference/` for a control article.
3. **Key concepts** - Important concepts specific to this control
4. **Examples** - Code examples and usage scenarios
5. **See also** - Consolidated reference links

#### 5.1 Styles and Templates Section
- The `## Styles and templates` section should always appear in the article. If not merging from another location, create it and add a brief introduction sentence.
- There should be a control reference file in `.github/projects/xaml/control-reference/` that contains the information about the control
- If the control reference file says there is no parts or visual states, include a brief note about that under the section.
- If template parts or visual states exist, include them as subsections under `## Styles and templates`:
  - `### Content property` and detail what contnent property is used and its purpose. If none, state "This control does not define a content property."
  - `### Parts` for template parts (sort table and add xref links)
  - `### Visual states` for visual states
  - If there are subcontrols, such as a data grid row, continue to include those as subsections under `## Styles and templates`

### 6. Clean Up Duplicate Content
- Ensure only ONE `## Styles and templates` section exists per article
- Consolidate all styling-related content into this single section
- Remove redundant explanations or repeated information

### 7. Create a Redirect Entry
- For any merged overview articles, add a redirect entry in `.openpublishing.redirection.wpf.json` to point from the old overview file to the main control file.
- Find any links to deleted files and change them.

### 8. Edit metadata

- Remove `f1_keywords` and `ms.assetid` metadata from the front matter
- Keep `helpviewer_keywords` if it exists
- Ensure `ai-usage: ai-assisted` is present in the front matter
- Update `ms.date` to the current date in `MM/DD/YYYY` format, with the year 2025.

## Quality Standards

- **Preserve content**: Never delete unique information during reorganization
- **Consistent headings**: Use sentence case for all headings
- **Complete sentences**: Ensure all list items are complete sentences with proper punctuation
- **Logical flow**: Information should progress from basic to advanced concepts
- **Cross-references**: Update any broken internal links after merging articles

## Success Criteria

After completion, each control article should:
- Follow the exact content structure outlined above
- Have consolidated reference sections
- Include modern image syntax
- Be free of duplicate or redundant sections
- Maintain all original unique content in a more organized format

## Quality Requirements

- Ensure introductory content appears before technical sections
- Preserve all unique content during article merges
- Maintain consistent section ordering across all control articles
