# How to: Resize Windows Forms

You can specify the size of your Windows Form in several ways. You can change both the height and the width of the form programmatically by setting a new value for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property, or adjust the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> properties individually. If you're using Visual Studio, you can change the size using the Windows Forms Designer. Also see [How to: Resize Windows Forms Using the Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/37k2zkwx(v=vs.100)).

## Resize a form programmatically

Define the size of a form at run time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property of the form.

The following code example shows the form size set to 100 Ã— 100 pixels.

```vb
Form1.Size = New System.Drawing.Size(100, 100)
```

```csharp
Form1.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(100, 100);
```

```cpp
Form1->Size = System::Drawing::Size(100, 100);
```

## Change form width and height programmatically

After the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> is defined, change either the form height or width by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> properties.

The following code example shows the width of the form set to 300 pixels from the left edge of the form, whereas the height stays constant.

```vb
Form1.Width = 300
```

```csharp
Form1.Width = 300;
```

```cpp
Form1->Width = 300;
```

-or-

Change <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property.

However, as the following code example shows, this approach is more cumbersome than just setting <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Width%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Height%2A> properties.

```vb
Form1.Size = New Size(300, Form1.Size.Height)
```

```csharp
Form1.Size = new Size(300, Form1.Size.Height);
```

```cpp
Form1->Size = System::Drawing::Size(300, Form1->Size.Height);
```

## Change form size by increments programmatically

To increment the size of the form, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> properties.

The following code example shows the width of the form set to 200 pixels wider than the current setting.

```vb
Form1.Width += 200
```

```csharp
Form1.Width += 200;
```

```cpp
Form1->Width += 200;
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Height%2A> or <xref:System.Drawing.Size.Width%2A> property to change a dimension of a form, unless you are setting both height and width dimensions at the same time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property to a new <xref:System.Drawing.Size> structure. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Size%2A> property returns a <xref:System.Drawing.Size> structure, which is a value type. You cannot assign a new value to the property of a value type. Therefore, the following code example will not compile.

```vb
' NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE
Dim f As New Form()
f.Size.Width += 100
```

```csharp
// NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE
Form f = new Form();
f.Size.Width += 100;
```

```cpp
// NOTE: CODE WILL NOT COMPILE
Form^ f = gcnew Form();
f->Size->X += 100;
```
