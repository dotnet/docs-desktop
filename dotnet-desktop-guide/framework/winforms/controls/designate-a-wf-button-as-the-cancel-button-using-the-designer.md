# How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button Using the Designer
On any Windows Form, you can designate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control to be the cancel button. A cancel button is clicked whenever the user presses the ESC key, regardless of which other control on the form has the focus. Such a button is usually programmed to enable the user to quickly exit an operation without committing to any action.

## To designate the cancel button

1. Select the form on which the button resides.

2. In the **Properties** window, set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.CancelButton%2A> property to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's name.
