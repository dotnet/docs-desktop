# BackgroundWorker Component
The `BackgroundWorker` component enables your form or control to run an operation asynchronously.  
  
## In This Section  
 [BackgroundWorker Component Overview](backgroundworker-component-overview.md)  
 Describes the `BackgroundWorker` component, which gives you the ability to execute time-consuming operations asynchronously ("in the background"), on a thread different from your application's main UI thread.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Running an Operation in the Background](walkthrough-running-an-operation-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component in the designer to run a time-consuming operation on a separate thread.  
  
 [How to: Run an Operation in the Background](how-to-run-an-operation-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component to run a time-consuming operation on a separate thread.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Implementing a Form That Uses a Background Operation](walkthrough-implementing-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)  
 Creates an application using the designer that does mathematical computations asynchronously.  
  
 [How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation](how-to-implement-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)  
 Creates an application that does mathematical computations asynchronously.  
  
 [How to: Download a File in the Background](how-to-download-a-file-in-the-background.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use the `BackgroundWorker` component to download a file on a separate thread.
