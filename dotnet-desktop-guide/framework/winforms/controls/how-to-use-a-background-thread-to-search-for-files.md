# How to: Use a Background Thread to Search for Files
The <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker> component replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Threading> namespace; however, the <xref:System.Threading> namespace is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see [BackgroundWorker Component Overview](backgroundworker-component-overview.md).

 Windows Forms uses the single-threaded apartment (STA) model because Windows Forms is based on native Win32 windows that are inherently apartment-threaded. The STA model implies that a window can be created on any thread, but it cannot switch threads once created, and all function calls to it must occur on its creation thread. Outside Windows Forms, classes in the .NET Framework use the free threading model. For information about threading in the .NET Framework, see [Threading](../../../standard/threading/index.md).

 The STA model requires that any methods on a control that need to be called from outside the control's creation thread must be marshaled to (executed on) the control's creation thread. The base class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> provides several methods (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.EndInvoke%2A>) for this purpose. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> makes synchronous method calls; <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A> makes asynchronous method calls.

 If you use multithreading in your control for resource-intensive tasks, the user interface can remain responsive while a resource-intensive computation executes on a background thread.

 The following sample (`DirectorySearcher`) shows a multithreaded Windows Forms control that uses a background thread to recursively search a directory for files matching a specified search string and then populates a list box with the search result. The key concepts illustrated by the sample are as follows:

- `DirectorySearcher` starts a new thread to perform the search. The thread executes the `ThreadProcedure` method that in turn calls the helper `RecurseDirectory` method to do the actual search and to populate the list box. However, populating the list box requires a cross-thread call, as explained in the next two bulleted items.

- `DirectorySearcher` defines the `AddFiles` method to add files to a list box; however, `RecurseDirectory` cannot directly invoke `AddFiles` because `AddFiles` can execute only in the STA thread that created `DirectorySearcher`.

- The only way `RecurseDirectory` can call `AddFiles` is through a cross-thread call â€” that is, by calling <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A> to marshal `AddFiles` to the creation thread of `DirectorySearcher`. `RecurseDirectory` uses <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A> so that the call can be made asynchronously.

- Marshaling a method requires the equivalent of a function pointer or callback. This is accomplished using delegates in the .NET Framework. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A> takes a delegate as an argument. `DirectorySearcher` therefore defines a delegate (`FileListDelegate`), binds `AddFiles` to an instance of `FileListDelegate` in its constructor, and passes this delegate instance to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A>. `DirectorySearcher` also defines an event delegate that is marshaled when the search is completed.

            // the search has terminated.
            // You do not have to do this through a marshaled call, but
            // marshaling is recommended for the following reason:
            // Users of this control do not know that it is
            // multithreaded, so they expect its events to
            // come back on the same thread as the control.
            BeginInvoke(onSearchComplete, new object[] {this, EventArgs.Empty});
         }
      }
   }
}

## Using the Multithreaded Control on a Form
 The following example shows how the multithreaded `DirectorySearcher` control can be used on a form.
