# ContextMenu Component (Windows Forms)
> [!NOTE]
> Although `MenuStrip` and `ContextMenuStrip` replace and add functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MainMenu> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> controls of previous versions, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MainMenu> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> are retained for both backward compatibility and future use if you choose.  
  
 The Windows Forms `ContextMenu` component is used to provide users with an easily accessible shortcut menu of frequently used commands that are associated with the selected object. The items in a shortcut menu are frequently a subset of the items from main menus that appear elsewhere in the application. Shortcut menus are usually available by right-clicking the mouse. On Windows Forms they are associated with other controls.
