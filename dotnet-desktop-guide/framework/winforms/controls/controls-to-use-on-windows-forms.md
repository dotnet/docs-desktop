The following is an alphabetic list of controls and components that can be used on Windows Forms.

For details, see [Developing Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](developing-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time.md). For more information about choosing the control you need, see [Windows Forms Controls by Function](windows-forms-controls-by-function.md).
