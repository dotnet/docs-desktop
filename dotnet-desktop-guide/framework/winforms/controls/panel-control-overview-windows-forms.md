# Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls. Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a panel gives the user a logical visual cue. At design time all the controls can be moved easily â€” when you move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, all its contained controls move, too. The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> property. This property returns a collection of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type.  
  
## Panel Versus GroupBox  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption.  
  
## Key Properties  
 To display scroll bars, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> property to `true`. You can also customize the appearance of the panel by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> properties. For more information on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> properties, see [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md). The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> property determines if the panel is outlined with no visible border (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.None>), a plain line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle>), or a shadowed line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.Fixed3D>).
