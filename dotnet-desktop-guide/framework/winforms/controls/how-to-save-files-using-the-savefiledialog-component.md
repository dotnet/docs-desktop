# How to: Save Files Using the SaveFileDialog Component

The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> component allows users to browse the file system and select files to be saved. The dialog box returns the path and name of the file the user has selected in the dialog box. However, you must write the code to actually write the files to disk.

### To save a file using the SaveFileDialog component

- Display the **Save File** dialog box and call a method to save the file selected by the user.

  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> component's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog.OpenFile%2A> method to save the file. This method gives you a <xref:System.IO.Stream> object you can write to.

  The example below uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult> property to get the name of the file, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog.OpenFile%2A> method to save the file. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog.OpenFile%2A> method gives you a stream to write the file to.

  In the example below, there is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control with an image assigned to it. When you click the button, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> component is instantiated with a filter that allows files of type .gif, .jpeg, and .bmp. If a file of this type is selected in the Save File dialog box, the button's image is saved.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > To get or set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.FileName%2A> property, your assembly requires a privilege level granted by the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission?displayProperty=nameWithType> class. If you are running in a partial-trust context, the process might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges. For more information, see [Code Access Security Basics](../../misc/code-access-security-basics.md).

  The example assumes your form has a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control with its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.Image%2A> property set to a file of type .gif, .jpeg, or .bmp.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog> class's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.FilterIndex%2A> property (which, due to inheritance, is part of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> class) uses a one-based index. This is important if you are writing code to save data in a specific format (for example, saving a file in plain text versus binary format). This property is featured in the example below.

  ```vb
  Private Sub Button2_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button2.Click
      ' Displays a SaveFileDialog so the user can save the Image
      ' assigned to Button2.
      Dim saveFileDialog1 As New SaveFileDialog()
      saveFileDialog1.Filter = "JPeg Image|*.jpg|Bitmap Image|*.bmp|Gif Image|*.gif"
      saveFileDialog1.Title = "Save an Image File"
      saveFileDialog1.ShowDialog()

      ' If the file name is not an empty string open it for saving.
      If saveFileDialog1.FileName <> "" Then
        ' Saves the Image via a FileStream created by the OpenFile method.
        Dim fs As System.IO.FileStream = Ctype _
            (saveFileDialog1.OpenFile(), System.IO.FileStream)
        ' Saves the Image in the appropriate ImageFormat based upon the
        ' file type selected in the dialog box.
        ' NOTE that the FilterIndex property is one-based.
        Select Case saveFileDialog1.FilterIndex
            Case 1
              Me.button2.Image.Save(fs, _
                  System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg)

            Case 2
              Me.button2.Image.Save(fs, _
                  System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Bmp)

            Case 3
              Me.button2.Image.Save(fs, _
                  System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Gif)
          End Select

          fs.Close()
      End If
  End Sub
  ```

  ```csharp
  private void button2_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
  {
      // Displays a SaveFileDialog so the user can save the Image
      // assigned to Button2.
      SaveFileDialog saveFileDialog1 = new SaveFileDialog();
      saveFileDialog1.Filter = "JPeg Image|*.jpg|Bitmap Image|*.bmp|Gif Image|*.gif";
      saveFileDialog1.Title = "Save an Image File";
      saveFileDialog1.ShowDialog();

      // If the file name is not an empty string open it for saving.
      if(saveFileDialog1.FileName != "")
      {
        // Saves the Image via a FileStream created by the OpenFile method.
        System.IO.FileStream fs =
            (System.IO.FileStream)saveFileDialog1.OpenFile();
        // Saves the Image in the appropriate ImageFormat based upon the
        // File type selected in the dialog box.
        // NOTE that the FilterIndex property is one-based.
        switch(saveFileDialog1.FilterIndex)
        {
            case 1 :
            this.button2.Image.Save(fs,
              System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
            break;

            case 2 :
            this.button2.Image.Save(fs,
              System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Bmp);
            break;

            case 3 :
            this.button2.Image.Save(fs,
              System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Gif);
            break;
        }

      fs.Close();
      }
  }
  ```

  ```cpp
  private:
      System::Void button2_Click(System::Object ^ sender,
        System::EventArgs ^ e)
      {
        // Displays a SaveFileDialog so the user can save the Image
        // assigned to Button2.
        SaveFileDialog ^ saveFileDialog1 = new SaveFileDialog();
        saveFileDialog1->Filter =
            "JPeg Image|*.jpg|Bitmap Image|*.bmp|Gif Image|*.gif";
        saveFileDialog1->Title = "Save an Image File";
        saveFileDialog1->ShowDialog();
        // If the file name is not an empty string, open it for saving.
        if(saveFileDialog1->FileName != "")
        {
            // Saves the Image through a FileStream created by
            // the OpenFile method.
            System::IO::FileStream ^ fs =
              safe_cast\<System::IO::FileStream*>(
              saveFileDialog1->OpenFile());
            // Saves the Image in the appropriate ImageFormat based on
            // the file type selected in the dialog box.
            // Note that the FilterIndex property is one based.
            switch(saveFileDialog1->FilterIndex)
            {
              case 1 :
                  this->button2->Image->Save(fs,
                    System::Drawing::Imaging::ImageFormat::Jpeg);
                  break;
              case 2 :
                  this->button2->Image->Save(fs,
                    System::Drawing::Imaging::ImageFormat::Bmp);
                  break;
              case 3 :
                  this->button2->Image->Save(fs,
                    System::Drawing::Imaging::ImageFormat::Gif);
                  break;
            }
        fs->Close();
        }
      }
  ```

  (Visual C# and Visual C++) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.

  ```csharp
  this.button2.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button2_Click);
  ```

  ```cpp
  this->button2->Click += gcnew
      System::EventHandler(this, &Form1::button2_Click);
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > Certain controls, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox> control, have the ability to save files.
