# How to: Resize controls on Windows Forms

You can resize individual controls, and you can resize multiple controls of the same or different kind, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls.

## To resize a control

In Visual Studio, select the control to be resized and drag one of the eight sizing handles.

> [!NOTE]
> Select the control and press the **arrow** keys while holding down the **Shift** key to resize the control one pixel at a time. Press the **down arrow** or **right arrow** keys while holding down the **Shift** and **Ctrl** keys to resize the control in large increments.

## To resize multiple controls on a form

1. In Visual Studio, hold down the **Ctrl** or **Shift** key and select the controls you want to resize. The size of the first control you select is used for the other controls.

2. On the **Format** menu, choose **Make Same Size**, and select one of the four options. The first three commands change the dimensions of the controls to match the first-selected control.
