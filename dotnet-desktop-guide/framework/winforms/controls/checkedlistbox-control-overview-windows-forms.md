# CheckedListBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> control extends the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> control. It does almost everything that a list box does and also can display a check mark next to items in the list. Other differences between the two controls are that checked list boxes only support <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode.Normal?displayProperty=nameWithType>; and that checked list boxes can only have one item or none selected. Note that a selected item appears highlighted on the form and is not the same as a checked item.  
  
 Checked list boxes can have items added at design time using the **String Collection Editor** or their items can added dynamically from a collection at run time, using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox.Items%2A> property. For more information, see [How to: Add and Remove Items from a Windows Forms ComboBox, ListBox, or CheckedListBox Control](add-and-remove-items-from-a-wf-combobox.md).
