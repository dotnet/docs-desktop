# RadioButton Control (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms `RadioButton` controls present a set of two or more mutually exclusive choices to the user. While radio buttons and check boxes may appear to function similarly, there is an important difference: when a user selects a radio button, the other radio buttons in the same group cannot be selected as well.
