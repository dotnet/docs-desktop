# StatusBar Control (Windows Forms)
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripStatusLabel> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  
  
 The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control is used on forms as an area, usually displayed at the bottom of a window, in which an application can display various kinds of status information. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> controls can have status-bar panels on them that display icons to indicate state, or a series of icons in an animation that indicate a process is working; for example, Microsoft Word indicating that the document is being saved.
