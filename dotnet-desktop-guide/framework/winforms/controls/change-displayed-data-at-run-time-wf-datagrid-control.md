# How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see [Differences Between the Windows Forms DataGridView and DataGrid Controls](differences-between-the-windows-forms-datagridview-and-datagrid-controls.md).  
  
 After you have created a Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> using the design-time features, you may also wish to dynamically change elements of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object of the grid at run time. This can include changes to either individual values of the table or changing which data source is bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control. Changes to individual values are done through the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object, not the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control.  
  
### To change data programmatically  
  
1. Specify the desired table from the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object and the desired row and field from the table and set the cell equal to the new value.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > To specify the first table of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or the first row of the table, use 0.  
  
     The following example shows how to change the second entry of the first row of the first table of a dataset by clicking `Button1`. The <xref:System.Data.DataSet> (`ds`) and Tables (`0` and `1`) were previously created.  
  
    ```vb  
    Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  
       ds.tables(0).rows(0)(1) = "NewEntry"  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  
    {  
       ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][1]="NewEntry";  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:
       void button1_Click(System::Object^ sender, System::EventArgs^ e)  
       {  
          dataSet1->Tables[0]->Rows[0][1] = "NewEntry";  
       }  
    ```  
  
     (Visual C#, Visual C++) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  
  
    ```csharp  
    this.button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    this->button1->Click +=  
       gcnew System::EventHandler(this, &Form1::button1_Click);  
    ```  
  
     At run time you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control to a different data source. For example, you may have several ADO.NET data controls, each connected to a different database.  
  
### To change the DataSource programmatically  
  
1. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to the name of the data source and table you want to bind to.  
  
     The following example shows how to change the date source using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to an ADO.NET data control (adoPubsAuthors) that is connected to the Authors table in the Pubs database.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub ResetSource()  
       DataGrid1.SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, "Authors")  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void ResetSource()  
    {  
       DataGrid1.SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, "Authors");  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void ResetSource()  
       {  
          dataGrid1->SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, "Authors");  
       }  
    ```
