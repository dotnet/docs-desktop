# Multithreading in Windows Forms Controls
In many applications, you can make your user interface (UI) more responsive by performing time-consuming operations on another thread. A number of tools are available for multithreading your Windows Forms controls, including the <xref:System.Threading> namespace, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, and the `BackgroundWorker` component.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The `BackgroundWorker` component replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Threading> namespace and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method; however, these are retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose. For more information, see [BackgroundWorker Component Overview](backgroundworker-component-overview.md).
