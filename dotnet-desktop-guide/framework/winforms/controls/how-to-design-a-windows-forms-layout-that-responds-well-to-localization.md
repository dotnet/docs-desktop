# How to: Design a Windows Forms Layout that Responds Well to Localization
Creating forms that are ready to be localized greatly speeds development for international markets. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to implement layouts that respond gracefully as controls resize due to changes in their <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property values.

## Example
 This form demonstrates how to create a layout that proportionally adjusts when you translate displayed string values into other languages. This process of translation is called *localization*. For more information, see [Localization](../../../standard/globalization-localization/localization.md).

 There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.  See also [Walkthrough: Creating a Layout That Adjusts Proportion for Localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/7k9fa71y(v=vs.100)).
