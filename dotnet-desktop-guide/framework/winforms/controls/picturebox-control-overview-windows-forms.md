# PictureBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control is used to display graphics in bitmap, GIF, JPEG, metafile, or icon format.  
  
## Key Properties and Methods  
 The picture that is displayed is determined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property, which can be set at run time or at design time. You can alternatively specify the image by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.ImageLocation%2A> property and then load the image synchronously using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Load%2A> method or asynchronously using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync%2A> method. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.SizeMode%2A> property controls how the image and control fit with each other. For more information, see [How to: Modify the Size or Placement of a Picture at Run Time](how-to-modify-the-size-or-placement-of-a-picture-at-run-time-windows-forms.md).
