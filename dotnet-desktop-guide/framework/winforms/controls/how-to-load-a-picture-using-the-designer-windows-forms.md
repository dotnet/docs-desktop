# How to: Load a Picture Using the Designer (Windows Forms)

With the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control, you can load and display a picture on a form at design time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property to a valid picture. The following table shows the acceptable file types.

|Type|File name extension|
|---|---|
|Bitmap|.bmp|
|Icon|.ico|
|GIF|.gif|
|Metafile|.wmf|
|JPEG|.jpg|

## To display a picture at design time

1. Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control on a form.

2. In the **Properties** window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property, then select the ellipsis button to display the **Open** dialog box.

3. If you're looking for a specific file type (for example, .gif files), select it in the **Files of type** box.

4. Select the file you want to display.

## To clear the picture at design time

1. In the **Properties** window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Image%2A> property. Right-click the small thumbnail image that appears to the left of the name of the image object, and then choose **Reset**.
