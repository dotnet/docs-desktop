# ComboBox Control (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms `ComboBox` control is used to display data in a drop-down combo box. By default, the `ComboBox` control appears in two parts: the top part is a text box that allows the user to type a list item. The second part is a list box that displays a list of items from which the user can select one.
