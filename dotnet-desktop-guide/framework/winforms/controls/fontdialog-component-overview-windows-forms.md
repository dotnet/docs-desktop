# FontDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FontDialog> component is a pre-configured dialog box, which is the standard Windows **Font** dialog box used to expose the fonts that are currently installed on the system. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution for font selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.  
  
 By default, the dialog box shows list boxes for Font, Font style, and Size; check boxes for effects like Strikeout and Underline; a drop-down list for Script; and a sample of how the font will appear. (Script refers to different character scripts that are available for a given font, for example, Hebrew or Japanese.) To display the font dialog box, call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method.  
  
## Key Properties  
 The component has a number of properties that configure its appearance. The properties that set the dialog-box selections are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FontDialog.Font%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FontDialog.Color%2A>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FontDialog.Font%2A> property sets the font, style, size, script, and effects; for example, `Arial, 10pt, style=Italic, Strikeout`.
