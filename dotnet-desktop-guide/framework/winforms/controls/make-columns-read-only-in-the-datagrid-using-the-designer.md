# How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer
By default, users can modify text and numerical data displayed in the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. If you want to display data that is not meant for modification, you must make the columns that contain the data read-only. For information about how to make the control entirely read-only, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md).

 The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).

## To make a column read-only by using the designer

1. Click the designer actions glyph (![Small black arrow](./media/designer-actions-glyph.gif)) on the upper-right corner of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, and then select **Edit Columns**.

2. Select a column from the **Selected Columns** list.

3. In the **Column Properties** grid, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also make a column read-only when you add it by selecting the **Read Only** check box in the **Add Column** dialog box.
