# How to: Display a Control in the Choose Toolbox Items Dialog Box

As you develop and distribute controls, you may want those controls to appear in the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box of Visual Studio, which is displayed when you right-click the **Toolbox** and select **Choose Items**. You can enable your control to appear in this dialog box by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure.

To display your control in the Choose Toolbox Items dialog box:

- Install your control assembly to the global assembly cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../app-domains/install-assembly-into-gac.md).

  -or-

- Register your control and its associated design-time assemblies by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure. AssemblyFoldersEx is a registry location where third-party vendors store paths for each version of the framework that they support. Design-time resolution can look in this registry location to find reference assemblies. The registry script can specify the controls you want to appear in the Toolbox.
