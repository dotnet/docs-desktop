# Rendering a Windows Forms Control
Rendering refers to the process of creating a visual representation on a user's screen. Windows Forms uses GDI (the new Windows graphics library) for rendering. The managed classes that provide access to GDI are in the <xref:System.Drawing?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace and its subnamespaces.  
  
 The following elements are involved in control rendering:  
  
- The drawing functionality provided by the base class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
- The essential elements of the GDI graphics library.  
  
- The geometry of the drawing region.  
  
- The procedure for freeing graphics resources.  
  
## Drawing Functionality Provided by Control  
 The base class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> provides drawing functionality through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event. A control raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event whenever it needs to update its display. For more information about events in the .NET Framework, see [Handling and Raising Events](../../../standard/events/index.md).  
  
 The event data class for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, holds the data needed for drawing a control — a handle to a graphics object and a rectangle object that represents the region to draw in. These objects are shown in bold in the following code fragment.  
  
```vb  
Public Class PaintEventArgs  
   Inherits EventArgs  
   Implements IDisposable  
  
   Public ReadOnly Property ClipRectangle() As System.Drawing.Rectangle  
      ...  
   End Property  
  
   Public ReadOnly Property Graphics() As System.Drawing.Graphics  
      ...  
   End Property  
   ' Other properties and methods.  
   ...  
End Class  
```  
  
```csharp  
public class PaintEventArgs : EventArgs, IDisposable {  
public System.Drawing.Rectangle ClipRectangle {get;}  
public System.Drawing.Graphics Graphics {get;}  
// Other properties and methods.  
...  
}  
```  
  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> is a managed class that encapsulates drawing functionality, as described in the discussion of GDI later in this topic. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> is an instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> structure and defines the available area in which a control can draw. A control developer can compute the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> property of a control, as described in the discussion of geometry later in this topic.  
  
 A control must provide rendering logic by overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method that it inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> gets access to a graphics object and a rectangle to draw in through the <xref:System.Drawing.Design.PaintValueEventArgs.Graphics%2A> and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> instance passed to it.  
  
```vb  
Protected Overridable Sub OnPaint(pe As PaintEventArgs)  
```  
  
```csharp  
protected virtual void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs pe);  
```  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method of the base <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class does not implement any drawing functionality but merely invokes the event delegates that are registered with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event. When you override <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>, you should typically invoke the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method of the base class so that registered delegates receive the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event. However, controls that paint their entire surface should not invoke the base class's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>, as this introduces flicker. For an example of overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> event, see the [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Do not invoke <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> directly from your control; instead, invoke the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> method (inherited from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>) or some other method that invokes <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> method in turn invokes <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> method is overloaded, and, depending on the arguments supplied to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> `e`, a control redraws either some or all of its screen area.  
  
 The base <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class defines another method that is useful for drawing — the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> method.  
  
```vb  
Protected Overridable Sub OnPaintBackground(pevent As PaintEventArgs)  
```  
  
```csharp  
protected virtual void OnPaintBackground(PaintEventArgs pevent);  
```  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> paints the background (and thereby the shape) of the window and is guaranteed to be fast, while <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> paints the details and might be slower because individual paint requests are combined into one <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event that covers all areas that have to be redrawn. You might want to invoke the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> if, for instance, you want to draw a gradient-colored background for your control.  
  
 While <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> has an event-like nomenclature and takes the same argument as the `OnPaint` method, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> is not a true event method. There is no `PaintBackground` event and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> does not invoke event delegates. When overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> method, a derived class is not required to invoke the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaintBackground%2A> method of its base class.  
  
## GDI+ Basics  
 The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing various shapes such as circles, triangles, arcs, and ellipses, as well as methods for displaying text. The <xref:System.Drawing?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace and its subnamespaces contain classes that encapsulate graphics elements such as shapes (circles, rectangles, arcs, and others), colors, fonts, brushes, and so on. For more information about GDI, see [Using Managed Graphics Classes](../advanced/using-managed-graphics-classes.md). The essentials of GDI are also described in the [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).  
  
## Geometry of the Drawing Region  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ClientRectangle%2A> property of a control specifies the rectangular region available to the control on the user's screen, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> specifies the area that is actually painted. (Remember that painting is done in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event method that takes a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> instance as its argument). A control might need to paint only a portion of its available area, as is the case when a small section of the control's display changes. In those situations, a control developer must compute the actual rectangle to draw in and pass that to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A>. The overloaded versions of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invalidate%2A> that take a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> or <xref:System.Drawing.Region> as an argument use that argument to generate the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>.  
  
 The following code fragment shows how the `FlashTrackBar` custom control computes the rectangular area to draw in. The `client` variable denotes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.ClipRectangle%2A> property. For a complete sample, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).

## Freeing Graphics Resources  
 Graphics objects are expensive because they use system resources. Such objects include instances of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?displayProperty=nameWithType> class as well as instances of <xref:System.Drawing.Brush?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Drawing.Pen?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and other graphics classes. It is important that you create a graphics resource only when you need it and release it soon as you are finished using it. If you create a type that implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, call its <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method when you are finished with it in order to free resources.  
  
 The following code fragment shows how the `FlashTrackBar` custom control creates and releases a <xref:System.Drawing.Brush> resource. For the complete source code, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).
