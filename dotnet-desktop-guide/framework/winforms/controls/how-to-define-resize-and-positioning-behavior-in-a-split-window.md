# How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window
The panels of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control lend themselves well to being resized and manipulated by users. However, there will be times when you will want to programmatically control the splitterâ€”where it is positioned and to what degree it can be moved.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property and the other properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs. These properties are listed in the following table.  
  
|Name|Description|  
|----------|-----------------|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A> property|Determines if the splitter is movable by means of the keyboard or mouse.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A> property|Determines the distance in pixels from the left or upper edge to the movable splitter bar.|  
|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property|Determines the minimum distance, in pixels, that the splitter can be moved by the user.|  
  
 The example below modifies the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to create a "snapping splitter" effect; when the user drags the splitter, it increments in units of 10 pixels rather than the default 1.  
  
### To define SplitContainer resize behavior  
  
1. In a procedure, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to the desired size, so that the 'snapping' behavior of the splitter is achieved.  
  
     In the following code example, within the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event, the splitter within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control is set to jump 10 pixels when dragged.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  
        ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load  
        Dim splitSnapper as new SplitContainer()  
        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10  
        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill  
        splitSnapper.Parent = me  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void Form1_Load(System.Object sender, System.EventArgs e)  
    {  
        SplitContainer splitSnapper = new SplitContainer();  
        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10;  
        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;  
        splitSnapper.Parent = this;  
    }  
    ```  
  
     (Visual C#) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  
  
    ```csharp  
    this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Form1_Load);  
    ```  
  
     Moving the splitter slightly to the left or right will have no discernible effect; however, when the mouse pointer goes 10 pixels in either direction, the splitter will snap to the new position.
