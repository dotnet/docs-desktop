# Handling User Input
This topic describes the main keyboard and mouse events provided by <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control?displayProperty=nameWithType>. When handling an event, control authors should override the protected `On`*EventName* method rather than attaching a delegate to the event. For a review of events, see [Raising Events from a Component](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/sh2e3k5z(v=vs.120)).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If there is no data associated with an event, an instance of the base class <xref:System.EventArgs> is passed as an argument to the `On`*EventName* method.  
  
## Keyboard Events  
 The common keyboard events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp>.  
  
|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|  
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|  
|`KeyDown`|`void OnKeyDown(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised only when a key is initially pressed.|  
|`KeyPress`|`void OnKeyPress`<br /><br /> `(KeyPressEventArgs)`|Raised every time a key is pressed. If a key is held down, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event is raised at the repeat rate defined by the operating system.|  
|`KeyUp`|`void OnKeyUp(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised when a key is released.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Handling keyboard input is considerably more complex than overriding the events in the preceding table and is beyond the scope of this topic. For more information, see [User Input in Windows Forms](../user-input-in-windows-forms.md).  
  
## Mouse Events  
 The mouse events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseHover>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseLeave>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseUp>.  
  
|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|  
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|  
|`MouseDown`|`void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is pressed while the pointer is over the control.|  
|`MouseEnter`|`void OnMouseEnter(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer first enters the region of the control.|  
|`MouseHover`|`void OnMouseHover(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer hovers over the control.|  
|`MouseLeave`|`void OnMouseLeave(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer leaves the region of the control.|  
|`MouseMove`|`void OnMouseMove(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer moves in the region of the control.|  
|`MouseUp`|`void OnMouseUp(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is released while the pointer is over the control or the pointer leaves the region of the control.|
