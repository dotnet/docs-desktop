# PrintPreviewDialog control overview (Windows Forms)

The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control is a pre-configured dialog box used to display how a [PrintDocument](printdocument-component-windows-forms.md) will appear when printed. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution instead of configuring your own dialog box. The control contains buttons for printing, zooming in, displaying one or multiple pages, and closing the dialog box.

## Key properties and methods

The control's key property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog.Document%2A>, which sets the document to be previewed. The document must be a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> object. In order to display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A> method. Anti-aliasing can make the text appear smoother, but it can also make the display slower; to use it, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog.UseAntiAlias%2A> property to `true`.

Certain properties are available through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> contains. (You do not have to add this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> to the form; it is automatically contained within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> when you add the dialog to your form.) Examples of properties available through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl> are the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Columns%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Rows%2A> properties, which determine the number of pages displayed horizontally and vertically on the control. You can access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Columns%2A> property as `PrintPreviewDialog1.PrintPreviewControl.Columns` in Visual Basic, `printPreviewDialog1.PrintPreviewControl.Columns` in Visual C#, or `printPreviewDialog1->PrintPreviewControl->Columns` in Visual C++.

## PrintPreviewDialog performance

Under the following conditions, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control initializes very slowly:

- A network printer is used.
- User preferences for this printer, such as duplex settings, are modified.

For apps running on the .NET Framework 4.5.2, you can add the following key to the \<appSettings> section of your configuration file to improve the performance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control initialization:

```xml
<appSettings>
   <add key="EnablePrintPreviewOptimization" value="true" />
</appSettings>
```

If the `EnablePrintPreviewOptimization` key is set to any other value, or if the key is not present, the optimization is not applied.

For apps running on the .NET Framework 4.6 or later versions, you can add the following switch to the [\<AppContextSwitchOverrides>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element.md) element in the [\<runtime>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md) section of your app config file:

```xml
<runtime >
Â   <!-- AppContextSwitchOverrides values are in the form of 'key1=true|false;key2=true|false -->
   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value = "Switch.System.Drawing.Printing.OptimizePrintPreview=true" />
</runtime >
```

If the switch is not present or if it is set to any other value, the optimization is not applied.

If you use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.QueryPageSettings> event to modify printer settings, the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control will not improve even if an optimization configuration switch is set.
