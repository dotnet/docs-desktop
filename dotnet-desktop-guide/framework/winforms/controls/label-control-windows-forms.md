# Label Control (Windows Forms)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripLabel> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripLabel> with other new controls such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDown>. However, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  
  
 Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> controls are used to display text or images that cannot be edited by the user. They are used to identify objects on a formâ€”to provide a description of what a certain control will do if clicked, for example, or to display information in response to a run-time event or process in your application. Because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control cannot receive focus, it can also be used to create access keys for other controls.
