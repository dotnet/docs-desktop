# Splitter Control (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms `Splitter` controls are used to resize docked controls at run time. The `Splitter` control is often used on forms with controls that have varying lengths of data to present, like Windows Explorer, whose data panes contain information of varying widths at different times.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Although <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> replaces and adds functionality to the `Splitter` control of previous versions, `Splitter` is retained for both backward compatibility and future use if you choose.
