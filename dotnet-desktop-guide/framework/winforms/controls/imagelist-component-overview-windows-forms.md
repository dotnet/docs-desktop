# ImageList Component Overview (Windows Forms)

The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> component is used to store images, which can then be displayed by controls. An image list allows you to write code for a single, consistent catalog of images. For example, you can rotate images displayed by a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control simply by changing the button's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.ImageIndex%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.ImageKey%2A> property. You can also associate the same image list with multiple controls. For example, if you are using both a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control to display the same list of files, changing a file's icon in the image list will cause the new icon to appear in both views.

## Using ImageList with Controls

You can use an image list with any control that has an `ImageList` property â€” or in the case of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.SmallImageList%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.LargeImageList%2A> properties. The controls that can be associated with an image list include: the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> controls. To associate the image list with a control, set the control's `ImageList` property to the name of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> component.

## Key Properties

The key property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> component is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList.Images%2A>, which contains the pictures to be used by the associated control. Each individual image can be accessed by its index value or by its key. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList.ColorDepth%2A> property determines the number of colors that the images are rendered with. The images will all be displayed at the same size, set by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList.ImageSize%2A> property. Images that are larger will be scaled to fit.
