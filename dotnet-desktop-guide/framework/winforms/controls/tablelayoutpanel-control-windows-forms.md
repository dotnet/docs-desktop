# TableLayoutPanel Control (Windows Forms)
The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control arranges its contents in a grid. Because the layout is performed both at design time and run time, it can change dynamically as the application environment changes. This gives the controls in the panel the ability to proportionally resize, so it can respond to changes such as the parent control resizing or text length changing due to localization.
