# GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)
Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls. Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars.
