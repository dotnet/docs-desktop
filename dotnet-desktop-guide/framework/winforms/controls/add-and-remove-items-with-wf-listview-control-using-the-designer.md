# How to: Add and Remove Items with the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer

The process of adding an item to a Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control consists primarily of specifying the item and assigning properties to it. Adding or removing list items can be done at any time.

The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).

### To add or remove items using the designer

1. Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control.

2. In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![The Ellipsis button (...) in the Properties window of Visual Studio.](./media/visual-studio-ellipsis-button.png)) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Items%2A> property.

     The **ListViewItem Collection Editor** appears.

3. To add an item, click the **Add** button. You can then set properties of the new item, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Text%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewItem.ImageIndex%2A> properties.

4. To remove an item, select it and click the **Remove** button.
