# ColorDialog Component (Windows Forms)
The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> component is a pre-configured dialog box that allows the user to select a color from a palette and to add custom colors to that palette. It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.
