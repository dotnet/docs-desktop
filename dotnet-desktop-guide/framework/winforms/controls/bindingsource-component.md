# BindingSource Component
Encapsulates a data source for binding to controls.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component serves two purposes. First, it provides a layer of indirection when binding the controls on a form to data. This is accomplished by binding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to your data source, and then binding the controls on your form to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. All further interaction with the data, including navigating, sorting, filtering, and updating, is accomplished with calls to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  
  
 Second, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component can act as a strongly typed data source. Adding a type to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Add%2A> method creates a list of that type.
