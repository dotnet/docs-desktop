# Windows Forms Print Support
Printing in Windows Forms consists primarily of using the [PrintDocument Component](../controls/printdocument-component-windows-forms.md) component to enable the user to print, and the [PrintPreviewDialog Control](../controls/printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md) control, [PrintDialog Component](../controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) and [PageSetupDialog Component](../controls/pagesetupdialog-component-windows-forms.md) components to provide a familiar graphical interface to users accustomed to the Windows operating system.  
  
 Typically, you create a new instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, set the properties that describe what to print using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings> classes, and call the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.Print%2A> method to actually print the document.  
  
 During the course of printing from a Windows-based application, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component will show an abort print dialog box to alert users to the fact that printing is occurring and to allow the print job to be canceled.
