# How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes
To create a figure, construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>, and then call methods, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddLine%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddCurve%2A>, to add primitives to the path.  
  
## Example  
 The following code examples create paths that have figures:  
  
- The first example creates a path that has a single figure. The figure consists of a single arc. The arc has a sweep angle of â€“180 degrees, which is counterclockwise in the default coordinate system.  
  
- The second example creates a path that has two figures. The first figure is an arc followed by a line. The second figure is a line followed by a curve followed by a line. The first figure is left open, and the second figure is closed.

## Compiling the Code  
 The previous examples are designed for use with Windows Forms, and they require <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.
