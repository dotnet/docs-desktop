# Bi-Directional Support for Windows Forms Applications
You can use Visual Studio to create Windows-based applications that support bi-directional (right-to-left) languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. This includes standard forms, dialog boxes, MDI forms, and all the controls you can work with in these formsâ€”that is, all the objects in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> namespace.

## Culture Support
 Culture and UI culture settings determine how an application works with dates, times, currency, and other information. Support for culture and UI culture is the same for bi-directional languages as it is for any other languages. For more information, see [Culture-specific classes for global Windows forms and web forms](/visualstudio/ide/globalizing-and-localizing-applications).

## RightToLeft and RightToLeftLayout Properties
 The base <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class, from which forms derive, includes a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property that you can set to change the reading order of a form and its controls. If you set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property, by default controls on the form inherit this setting. However, you can also set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property individually on most controls. Also see [How to: Display Right-to-Left Text in Windows Forms for Globalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/7d3337xw(v=vs.100)).

 The effect of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property can differ from one control to another. In some controls the property only sets the reading order, as in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolTip> controls. In other controls, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property changes both reading order and layout. This includes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> controls. Other controls require that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.RightToLeftLayout%2A> property be applied to mirror its layout from right to left. The following table provides details on how the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.RightToLeftLayout%2A> properties affect individual Windows Forms controls.

## Encoding
 Windows Forms support Unicode, so you can include any character set when you create your bi-directional applications. However, not all Windows Forms controls support Unicode on all platforms.

## GDI+
 You can use GDI+ to draw text with right-to-left reading order. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method, which is used to draw text, supports a `StringFormat` parameter that you can set to the <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormatFlags.DirectionRightToLeft> member of the <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormatFlags> enumeration in order to reverse the point of origin for the text.

## Common Dialog Boxes
 System tools such as the File Open dialog box are under the control of Windows. They inherit language elements from the operating system. If you are using a version of Windows with the correct language settings, these dialog boxes will work correctly with bi-directional languages.

 Similarly, message boxes go through the operating system and support bi-directional text. The captions on message box buttons are based on the current language setting. By default, message boxes do not use right-to-left reading order, but you can specify a parameter to change the reading order when the message boxes are displayed.

## RightToLeft, Scrollbars, and ScrollableControl
 There is currently a limitation in Windows Forms that prevents all classes derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl> from acting properly when both <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> is enabled and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RightToLeft.Yes>. For example, let's say that you place a control such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>â€”or a container class derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> (such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel>)â€”on your form. If you set <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> on the container to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RightToLeft.Yes> and then set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property on one or more of the controls inside of the container to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.Right>, then no scrollbar ever appears. The class derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl> acts as if <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> were set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RightToLeft.No>.

 Currently, the only workaround is to nest the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl> inside another <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl>. For instance, if you need <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> to work in this situation, you can place it inside of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control and set <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RightToLeft.Yes>.

## Mirroring
 *Mirroring* refers to reversing the layout of UI elements so that they flow from right to left. In a mirrored Windows Form, for example, the Minimize, Maximize, and Close buttons appear left-most on the title bar, not right-most.

 Setting a form or control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.RightToLeft%2A> property to `true` reverses the reading order of elements on a form, but this setting does not reverse the layout to be right-to-leftâ€” that is, it does not cause mirroring. For example, setting this property does not move the **Minimize**, **Maximize**, and **Close** buttons in the form's title bar to the left side of the form. Similarly, some controls, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control, require mirroring in order to change their display to be appropriate for Arabic or Hebrew. You can mirror these controls by settings the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.RightToLeftLayout%2A> property.

 You can create mirrored versions of the following controls:

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader.ListView%2A>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabPage>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar>

- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView>

 Some controls are sealed. Therefore, you cannot derive a new control from them. These include the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar> controls.
