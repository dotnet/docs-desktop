# How To: Create a new setting at design time

You can create a new setting at design time by using the Settings designer in Visual Studio. The Settings designer is a grid-style interface that allows you to create new settings and specify properties for those settings. You must specify Name, Value, Type and Scope for your new settings. Once a setting is created, it is accessible in code.

## Create a new setting at design time in C\#

1. Open Visual Studio.

2. In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Properties** node of your project.

3. Double-click the .settings file in which you want to add a new setting. The default name for this file is Settings.settings.

4. In the Settings designer, set the **Name**, **Value**, **Type**, and **Scope** for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.

## Create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic
