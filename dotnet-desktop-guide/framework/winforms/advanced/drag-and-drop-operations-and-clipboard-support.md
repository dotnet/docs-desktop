# Drag-and-Drop Operations and Clipboard Support
You can enable user drag-and-drop operations within a Windows-based application by handling a series of events, most notably the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragLeave>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> events.  
  
 You can also implement user cut/copy/paste support and user data transfer to the Clipboard within your Windows-based applications by using simple method calls.
