# How to: Print a Multi-Page Text File in Windows Forms
It is very common for Windows-based applications to print text. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects (graphics or text) to a device, such as a screen or printer.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> are not supported for printing. You should always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods of <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, as shown in the following code example, to draw text for printing purposes.  
  
### To print text  
  
1. Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component and a string to your form.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#8)]
     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#8)]  
  
2. If printing a document, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property to the document you wish to print, and open and read the documents contents to the string you added previously.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  
  
3. In the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler, use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class and the document contents to calculate line length and lines per page. After each page is drawn, check to see if it is the last page, and set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> accordingly. The <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event is raised until <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages%2A> is `false`. Also, make sure the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event is associated with its event-handling method.  
  
     In the following code example, the event handler is used to print the contents of the "testPage.txt" file in the same font as is used on the form.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
4. Call the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.Print%2A> method to raise the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#5)]  
  
## Example  
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#0](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#0)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#0](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#0)]  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 This example requires:  
  
- A text file named testPage.txt containing the text to print, located in the root of drive C:\\. Edit the code to print a different file.  
  
- References to the System, System.Windows.Forms, System.Drawing assemblies.  
  
- For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.
