# How to: Create a Pen
This example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#3](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#3)]
 [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#3)]
 [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#3)]  
  
## Robust Programming  
 After you have finished using objects that consume system resources, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> objects, you should call <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.Dispose%2A> on them.
