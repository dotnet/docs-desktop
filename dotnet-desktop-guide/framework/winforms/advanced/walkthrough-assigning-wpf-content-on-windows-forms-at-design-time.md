# Walkthrough: Assign WPF content on Windows Forms at design time

This article show you how to select the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control types you want to display on your form. You can select any WPF control types that are included in your project.

## Prerequisites

You need Visual Studio to complete this walkthrough.

## Create the project

Open Visual Studio and create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `SelectingWpfContent`.

> [!NOTE]
> When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.

## Create the WPF control types

After you add WPF control types to the project, you can host them in different <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls.

1. Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> project to the solution. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).

2. In Design view, make sure that `UserControl1` is selected.

3. In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to **200**.

4. Add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=nameWithType> control to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> and set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property to **Hosted Content**.

5. Add a second WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to the project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl2.xaml`.

6. In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to **200**.

7. Add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=nameWithType> control to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> and set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property to **Hosted Content 2**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > In general, you should host more sophisticated WPF content. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=nameWithType> control is used here for illustrative purposes only.

8. Build the project.

## Select WPF controls

You can assign different WPF content to an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control, which is already hosting content.

1. Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.

2. In the **Toolbox**, double-click `UserControl1` to create an instance of `UserControl1` on the form.

   An instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.

3. In the smart tag panel for `elementHost1`, open the **Select Hosted Content** drop-down list.

4. Select **UserControl2** from the drop-down list box.

   The `elementHost1` control now hosts an instance of the `UserControl2` type.

5. In the **Properties** window, confirm that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost.Child%2A> property is set to **UserControl2**.

6. From the **Toolbox**, in the **WPF Interoperability** group, drag an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control onto the form.

   The default name for the new control is `elementHost2`.

7. In the smart tag panel for `elementHost2`, open the **Select Hosted Content** drop-down list.

8. Select **UserControl1** from the drop-down list.

9. The `elementHost2` control now hosts an instance of the `UserControl1` type.
