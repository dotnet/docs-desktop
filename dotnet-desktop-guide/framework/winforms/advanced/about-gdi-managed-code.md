# About GDI+ Managed Code

GDI+ is the portion of the Windows operating system that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography. GDI+ improves on GDI (the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows) by adding new features and by optimizing existing features.

The GDI+ managed class interface (a set of wrappers) is part of the .NET Framework, an environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and other applications.

This section provides information about the GDI+ API for programmers using managed code.
