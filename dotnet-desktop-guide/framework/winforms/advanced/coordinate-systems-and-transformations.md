# Coordinate Systems and Transformations
GDI+ provides a world transformation and a page transformation so that you can transform (rotate, scale, translate, and so on) the items you draw. The two transformations also allow you to work in a variety of coordinate systems.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Types of Coordinate Systems](types-of-coordinate-systems.md)  
 Introduces coordinates systems and transformations.  
  
 [Matrix Representation of Transformations](matrix-representation-of-transformations.md)  
 Discusses using matrices for coordinate transformations.  
  
 [Global and Local Transformations](global-and-local-transformations.md)  
 Discusses global and local transformations.  
  
## Reference  
 <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix>  
 Encapsulates a 3-by-3 affine matrix that represents a geometric transform.
