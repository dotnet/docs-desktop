# Lines, Curves, and Shapes
The vector graphics portion of GDI+ is used to draw lines, draw curves, and to draw and fill shapes.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Vector Graphics Overview](vector-graphics-overview.md)  
 Discusses vector graphics.  
  
 [Pens, Lines, and Rectangles in GDI+](pens-lines-and-rectangles-in-gdi.md)  
 Discusses drawing lines and rectangles.  
  
 [Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+](ellipses-and-arcs-in-gdi.md)  
 Defines arcs and ellipses and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  
  
 [Polygons in GDI+](polygons-in-gdi.md)  
 Defines polygons and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  
  
 [Cardinal Splines in GDI+](cardinal-splines-in-gdi.md)  
 Defines cardinal splines and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  
  
 [BÃ©zier Splines in GDI+](bezier-splines-in-gdi.md)  
 Defines Bezier splines and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  
  
 [Graphics Paths in GDI+](graphics-paths-in-gdi.md)  
 Describes paths and how to create and draw them.  
  
 [Brushes and Filled Shapes in GDI+](brushes-and-filled-shapes-in-gdi.md)  
 Describes brush types and how to use them.  
  
 [Open and Closed Curves in GDI+](open-and-closed-curves-in-gdi.md)  
 Defines open and closed curves and how to draw and fill them.  
  
 [Regions in GDI+](regions-in-gdi.md)  
 Describes the methods associated with regions.  
  
 [Restricting the Drawing Surface in GDI+](restricting-the-drawing-surface-in-gdi.md)  
 Describes clipping and how to use it.  
  
 [Antialiasing with Lines and Curves](antialiasing-with-lines-and-curves.md)  
 Defines antialiasing and how use antialiasing when drawing lines and curves.
