# How to: Implement the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface
The following code example demonstrates how to implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface. Implement this interface on business objects that are used in Windows Forms data binding. When implemented, the interface  communicates to a bound control the property changes on a business object.
