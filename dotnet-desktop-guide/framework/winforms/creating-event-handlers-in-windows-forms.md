# Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms

An event handler is a procedure in your code that determines what actions are performed when an event occurs, such as when the user clicks a button or a message queue receives a message. When an event is raised, the event handler or handlers that receive the event are executed. Events can be assigned to multiple handlers, and the methods that handle particular events can be changed dynamically. You can also use the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio to create event handlers.
