# How to: Create a Windows Forms application from the command line

The following procedures describe the basic steps that you must complete to create and run a Windows Forms application from the command line. There is extensive support for these procedures in Visual Studio.  Also see [Walkthrough: Hosting a Windows Forms Control in WPF](../wpf/advanced/walkthrough-hosting-a-windows-forms-control-in-wpf.md).
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To create the form  
  
1. In an empty code file, type the following `Imports` or `using` statements:  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
2. Declare a class named `Form1` that inherits from the Form class:
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/CS/Form1.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  
  
3. Create a parameterless constructor for `Form1`.
  
     You will add more code to the constructor in a subsequent procedure.
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/CS/Form1.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/VB/Form1.vb#4)]  
  
4. Add a `Main` method to the class.
  
    1. Apply the <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> to the C# `Main` method to specify your Windows Forms application is a single-threaded apartment. (The attribute is not necessary in Visual Basic, since Windows forms applications developed with Visual Basic use a single-threaded apartment model by default.)  
  
    2. Call <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A> to apply operating system styles to your application.  
  
    3. Create an instance of the form and run it.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/CS/Form1.cs#5)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BasicForm/VB/Form1.vb#5)]  
  
#### To compile and run the application  
  
1. At the .NET Framework command prompt, navigate to the directory you created the `Form1` class.  
  
2. Compile the form.  
  
    - If you are using C#, type: `csc form1.cs`  
  
         `-or-`  
  
    - If you are using Visual Basic, type: `vbc form1.vb`  
  
3. At the command prompt, type: `Form1.exe`  
  
## Adding a control and handling an event

The previous procedure steps demonstrated how to just create a basic Windows Form that compiles and runs. The next procedure will show you how to create and add a control to the form, and handle an event for the control. For more information about the controls you can add to Windows Forms, see [Windows Forms Controls](./controls/index.md).
  
 In addition to understanding how to create Windows Forms applications, you should understand event-based programming and how to handle user input. For more information, see [Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms](creating-event-handlers-in-windows-forms.md), and [Handling User Input](./controls/handling-user-input.md)  
  
#### To declare a button control and handle its click event  
  
1. Declare a button control named `button1`.  
  
2. In the constructor, create the button and set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Size%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> properties.  
  
3. Add the button to the form.  
  
     The following code example demonstrates how to declare the button control:
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/CS/Form1.cs#2)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  
  
4. Create a method to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event for the button.  
  
5. In the click event handler, display a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> with the message, "Hello World".  
  
     The following code example demonstrates how to handle the button control's click event:
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/CS/Form1.cs#3)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  
  
6. Associate the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event with the method you created.  
  
     The following code example demonstrates how to associate the event with the method.  
  
     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/CS/Form1.cs#4)]
     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/VB/Form1.vb#4)]  
  
7. Compile and run the application as described in the previous procedure.  
  
## Example  

The following code example is the complete example from the previous procedures:
  
 [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/CS/Form1.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FormWithButton/VB/Form1.vb#1)]
