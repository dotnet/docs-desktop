# How to: Make Data Available for Binding in XAML

This topic discusses various ways you can make data available for binding in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), depending on the needs of your application.  
  
## Example  

 If you have a common language runtime (CLR) object you would like to bind to from XAML, one way you can make the object available for binding is to define it as a resource and give it an `x:Key`. In the following example, you have a `Person` object with a string property named `PersonName`. The `Person` object (in the line shown highlighted that contains the `<src>` element) is defined in the namespace called `SDKSample`.  
  
 [!code-xaml[SimpleBinding#Instantiation](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleBinding/CSharp/Page1.xaml?highlight=9,37)]  
  
 You can then bind the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control to the object in XAML, as the highlighted line that contains the `<TextBlock>` element shows.
  
 Alternatively, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class, as in the following example:  
  
 [!code-xaml[ObjectDataProvider}](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleBinding/VisualBasic/Page1.xaml?highlight=10-14,42)]  
  
 You define the binding the same way, as the highlighted line that contains the `<TextBlock>` element shows.  
  
 In this particular example, the result is the same: you have a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the text content `Joe`. However, the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class provides functionality such as the ability to bind to the result of a method. You can choose to use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class if you need the functionality it provides.  
  
 However, if you are binding to an object that has already been created, you need to set the `DataContext` in code, as in the following example.  
  
 [!code-csharp[ADODataSet#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ADODataSet/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#1)]
 [!code-vb[ADODataSet#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ADODataSet/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#1)]  
  
 To access XML data for binding using the <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider> class, see [Bind to XML Data Using an XMLDataProvider and XPath Queries](how-to-bind-to-xml-data-using-an-xmldataprovider-and-xpath-queries.md). To access XML data for binding using the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class, see [Bind to XDocument, XElement, or LINQ for XML Query Results](how-to-bind-to-xdocument-xelement-or-linq-for-xml-query-results.md).  
  
 For information about many ways you can specify the data you are binding to, see [Specify the Binding Source](how-to-specify-the-binding-source.md). For information about what types of data you can bind to or how to implement your own common language runtime (CLR) objects for binding, see [Binding Sources Overview](binding-sources-overview.md).
