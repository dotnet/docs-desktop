# How to: Bind the Properties of Two Controls

This example shows how to bind the property of one instantiated control to that of another using the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.ElementName%2A> property.

## Example

The following example shows how to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Background%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to the [SelectedItem.Content](xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.Content%2A) property of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>:

> [!NOTE]
> The binding target property (in this example, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Background%2A> property) must be a dependency property. For more information, see [Data Binding Overview](/dotnet/desktop-wpf/data/data-binding-overview).
