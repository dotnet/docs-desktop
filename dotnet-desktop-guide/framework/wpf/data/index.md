# Data

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) data binding provides a simple and consistent way for applications to present and interact with data. Elements can be bound to data from a variety of data sources in the form of common language runtime (CLR) objects and XML. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) also provides a mechanism for the transfer of data through drag-and-drop operations.
