# How to: Hit Test Geometry in a Visual
This example shows how to perform a hit test on a visual object that is composed of one or more <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> objects.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to retrieve the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingGroup> from a visual object that uses the <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualTreeHelper.GetDrawing%2A> method. A hit test is then performed on the rendered content of each drawing in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingGroup> to determine which geometry was hit.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In most cases, you would use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualTreeHelper.HitTest%2A> method to determine whether a point intersects any of the rendered content of a visual.

 The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.FillContains%2A> method is an overloaded method that allows you to hit test by using a specified <xref:System.Windows.Point> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry>. If a geometry is stroked, the stroke can extend outside the fill bounds. In which case, you may want to call <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.StrokeContains%2A> in addition to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.FillContains%2A>.  
  
 You can also provide a <xref:System.Windows.Media.ToleranceType> that is used for the purposes of Bezier flattening.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This sample does not take into account any transforms or clipping that may be applied to the geometry. In addition, this sample will not work with a styled control, since it does not have any drawings directly associated with it.
