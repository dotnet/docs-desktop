# How to: Use Event Triggers to Control a Storyboard After It Starts

This example shows how to control a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> after it starts. To start a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> by using [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], use <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard>, which distributes the animations to the objects and properties they animate and then starts the storyboard. If you give <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> a name by specifying its <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.Name%2A> property, you make it a controllable storyboard. You can then interactively control the storyboard after it starts.

Use the following storyboard actions together with <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger> objects to control a storyboard.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.PauseStoryboard>: Pauses the storyboard.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ResumeStoryboard>: Resumes a paused storyboard.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SetStoryboardSpeedRatio>: Changes the storyboard speed.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SkipStoryboardToFill>: Advances a storyboard to the end of its fill period, if it has one.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.StopStoryboard>: Stops the storyboard.

- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.RemoveStoryboard>: Removes the storyboard, freeing resources.

## Example

The following example uses controllable storyboard actions to interactively control a storyboard.
