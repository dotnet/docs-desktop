# How to: Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard

This example shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> to animate properties. To animate a property by using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>, create an animation for each property that you want to animate and also create a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> to contain the animations.  
  
 The type of property determines the type of animation to use. For example, to animate a property that takes <xref:System.Double> values, use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation>. The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.TargetName%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.TargetProperty> attached properties specify the object and property to which the animation is applied.  
  
 To start a storyboard in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> action and an <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger>. The <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger> begins the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> action when the event that is specified by its <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger.RoutedEvent%2A> property occurs. The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> action starts the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>.  
  
 The following example uses <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> objects to animate two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls. To make the first button change in size, its <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> is animated. To make the second button change color, the <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush.Color%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush> is used to set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of the button that is animated.  
  
## Example  

 [!code-xaml[AnimatePropertyStoryboards#1](~/samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/AnimatePropertyStoryboards/XAML/StoryboardExample.xaml#1)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Although animations can target both a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> object, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>, and a <xref:System.Windows.Freezable> object, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Transform>, only framework elements have a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property. To assign a name to a freezable so that it can be targeted by an animation, use the [x:Name Directive](/dotnet/desktop/xaml-services/xname-directive), as the previous example shows.  
  
 If you use code, you must create a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> for a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> and register the names of the objects to animate with that <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>. To start the animations in code, use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> action with an <xref:System.Windows.EventTrigger>. Optionally, you can use an event handler and the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>. The following example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method.

 If you use code, you are not limited to using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> objects in order to animate properties.
