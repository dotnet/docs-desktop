# How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment
This example shows how to modify the shape at the start or end of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> element. To change the cap at the beginning of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeStartLineCap%2A> property. To change the cap at the end of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeEndLineCap%2A> property. To view the available line caps, see the <xref:System.Windows.Media.PenLineCap> enumeration.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This property only affects an open shape, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, or an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> element.  
  
 The following example draws four <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> elements and uses a different set of shapes on the ends of each.
