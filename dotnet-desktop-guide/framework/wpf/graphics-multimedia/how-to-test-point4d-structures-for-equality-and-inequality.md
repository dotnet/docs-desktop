# How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality
This example shows how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality.  
  
 The following code illustrates how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> equality methods.  The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (`==`) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (`!=`) operator, and finally a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D> structure and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structure are checked for equality using the static <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A> method.
