# Shapes

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) provides support for drawing basic shapes using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> class. Shape objects derive from <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> and as such, participate in the layout system and can be drawn simply using Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML).
