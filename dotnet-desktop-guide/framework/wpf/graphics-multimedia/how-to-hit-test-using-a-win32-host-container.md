# How to: Hit Test Using a Win32 Host Container

You can create visual objects within a Win32 window by providing a host window container for the visual objects. To provide event handling for the contained visual objects you process the messages passed to the host window containerâ€™s message filter loop. Refer to [Tutorial: Hosting Visual Objects in a Win32 Application](tutorial-hosting-visual-objects-in-a-win32-application.md) for more information on how to host visual objects in a Win32 window.  
  
## Example  

 The following code shows how to set up mouse event handlers for a Win32 window that is used as a host container for visual objects.  
  
 [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#103](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyWindow.cs#103)]
 [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#103](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyWindow.vb#103)]  
  
 The following example shows how to set up a hit test in response to trapping specific mouse events.  
  
 [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#104](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyCircle.cs#104)]
 [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#104](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyCircle.vb#104)]  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object presents Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) content within a Win32 window. The value of the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.RootVisual%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object represents the top-most node in the visual tree hierarchy.  
  
 For the complete sample on hit testing objects using a Win32 host container, see [Hit Test with Win32 Interoperation Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples/tree/master/Visual%20Layer/VisualsHitTesting).
