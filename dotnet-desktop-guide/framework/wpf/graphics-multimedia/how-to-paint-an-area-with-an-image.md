# How to: Paint an Area with an Image
This example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush> class to paint an area with an image. An <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush> displays a single image, which is specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush.ImageSource%2A> property.  
  
## Example  
 The following example paints the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of a button by using an <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush>.  
  
 [!code-csharp[UsingImageBrush_snip#ImageBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UsingImageBrush_snip/CSharp/PaintingWithImagesExample.cs#imagebrushexamplewholepage)]  
  
 By default, an <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush> stretches its image to completely fill the area that you are painting. In the preceding example, the image is stretched to fill the button, possibly distorting the image. You can control this behavior by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.Stretch%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush> to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch.Uniform> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch.UniformToFill>, which causes the brush to preserve the aspect ratio of the image.  
  
 If you set the <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.Viewport%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.TileMode%2A> properties of an <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageBrush>, you can create a repeating pattern. The following example paints a button by using a pattern that is created from an image.
