# How to: Set a Property After Animating It with a Storyboard
In some cases, it might appear that you can't change the value of a property after it has been animated.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> is used to animate the color of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush>. The storyboard is triggered when the button is clicked. The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.Completed> event is handled so that the program is notified when the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> completes.  
  
 [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton1Declaration](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AnimateThenSetPropertyExample.xaml#graphicsmmbutton1declaration)]  
  
## Example  
 After the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> completes, the program attempts to change the brush's color to blue.  
  
 [!code-csharp[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton1Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AnimateThenSetPropertyExample.xaml.cs#graphicsmmbutton1handler)]
 [!code-vb[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton1Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/visualbasic/animatethensetpropertyexample.xaml.vb#graphicsmmbutton1handler)]  
  
 The previous code doesn't appear to do anything: the brush remains yellow, which is the value supplied by the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> that animated the brush. The underlying property value (the base value) is actually changed to blue. However, the effective, or current, value remains yellow because the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> is still overriding the base value. If you want the base value to become the effective value again, you must stop the animation from influencing the property. There are three ways to do this with storyboard animations:  
  
- Set the animation's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.FillBehavior.Stop>  
  
- Remove the entire Storyboard.  
  
- Remove the animation from the individual property.  
  
## Set the animation's FillBehavior property to Stop  
 By setting <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.FillBehavior.Stop>, you tell the animation to stop affecting its target property after it reaches the end of its active period.

 [!code-vb[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton2Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/visualbasic/animatethensetpropertyexample.xaml.vb#graphicsmmbutton2handler)]  
  
## Remove the entire storyboard  
 By using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.RemoveStoryboard> trigger or the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Remove%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, you tell the storyboard animations to stop affecting their target properties. The difference between this approach and setting the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> property is that you can remove the storyboard at anytime, while the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> property only has an effect when the animation reaches the end of its active period.

 [!code-csharp[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton3Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AnimateThenSetPropertyExample.xaml.cs#graphicsmmbutton3handler)]
 [!code-vb[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton3Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/visualbasic/animatethensetpropertyexample.xaml.vb#graphicsmmbutton3handler)]  
  
## Remove an animation from an individual property  
 Another technique to stop an animation from affecting a property is to use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%28System.Windows.DependencyProperty%2CSystem.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline%29> method of the object being animated. Specify the property being animated as the first parameter and `null` as the second.  
  
 [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton4Declaration](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AnimateThenSetPropertyExample.xaml#graphicsmmbutton4declaration)]  
  
 [!code-csharp[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton4Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AnimateThenSetPropertyExample.xaml.cs#graphicsmmbutton4handler)]
 [!code-vb[timingbehaviors_snip#GraphicsMMButton4Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/visualbasic/animatethensetpropertyexample.xaml.vb#graphicsmmbutton4handler)]  
  
 This technique also works for non-storyboard animations.
