# How to: Define a Name Scope
To animate with <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> in code, you must create a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> and register the target objects' names with the element that owns that name scope. In the following example, a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> is created for `myMainPanel`. Two buttons, `button1` and `button2`, are added to the panel, and their names registered. Several animations and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> are created. The storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method is used to start the animations.  
  
 Because `button1`, `button2`, and `myMainPanel` all share the same name scope, any one of them can be used with the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method to start the animations.
