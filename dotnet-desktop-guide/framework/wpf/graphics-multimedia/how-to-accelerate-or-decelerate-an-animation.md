# How to: Accelerate or decelerate an animation

This example demonstrates how to make an animation accelerate and decelerate over time. In the following example, several rectangles are animated by animations with different <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.AccelerationRatio%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.DecelerationRatio%2A> settings.
