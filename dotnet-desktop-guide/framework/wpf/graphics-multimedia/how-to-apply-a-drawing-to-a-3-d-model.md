# How to: Apply a Drawing to a 3D Model

This example shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> as the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Material> applied to a 3D model.

The following code defines a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingGroup> as the content of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush>.  The <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> is set as the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.DiffuseMaterial.Brush%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.DiffuseMaterial> applied to a 3D plane.

> [!NOTE]
> It is often desirable to define complex objects and values like the drawing below as resources which can be reused and simplify your code. See [XAML Resources](/dotnet/desktop-wpf/fundamentals/xaml-resources-define) for more information.
