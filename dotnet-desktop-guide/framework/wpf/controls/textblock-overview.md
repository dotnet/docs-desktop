# TextBlock Overview
The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control provides flexible text support for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications. The element is targeted primarily toward basic [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] scenarios that do not require more than one paragraph of text. It supports a number of properties that enable precise control of presentation, such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.FontFamily%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.FontSize%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.FontWeight%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextEffects%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextWrapping%2A>. Text content can be added using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.Text%2A> property. When used in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], content between the open and closing tag is implicitly added as the text of the element.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element can be instantiated very simply using [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)].  
  
 [!code-xaml[TextBlockSnip_XAML#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextBlockSnip_XAML/CS/default.xaml#2)]  
  
 Similarly, usage of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element in code is relatively simple.
