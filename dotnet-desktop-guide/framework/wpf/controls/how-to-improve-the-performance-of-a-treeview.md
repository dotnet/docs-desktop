# How to: Improve the Performance of a TreeView
If a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> contains many items, the amount of time it takes to load may cause a significant delay in the user interface. You can improve the load time by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing` attached property to `true`.  The UI might also be slow to react when a user scrolls the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> by using the mouse wheel or dragging the thumb of a scrollbar. You can improve the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> when the user scrolls by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  
  
## Example  
  
## Description  
The following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> that sets the `VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing` attached property to true and the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType> to optimize its performance.  
  
## Code  
 [!code-xaml[RecycleItemContainerShippets#VirtualizingTreeView](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml#virtualizingtreeview)]  
  
 The following example shows the data that the previous example uses.
