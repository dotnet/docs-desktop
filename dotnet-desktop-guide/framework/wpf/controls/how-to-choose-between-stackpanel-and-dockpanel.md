# How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel
This example shows how to choose between using a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> or a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> when you stack content in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>.

## Example
 Although you can use either <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> to stack child elements, the two controls do not always produce the same results. For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> but not in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. This different behavior occurs because <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> measures in the direction of stacking at [Double.PositiveInfinity](xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity); however, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> measures only the available size.

 The following example demonstrates this key difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>.
