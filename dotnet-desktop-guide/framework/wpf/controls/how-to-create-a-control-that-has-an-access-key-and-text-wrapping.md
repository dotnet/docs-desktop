# How to: Create a Control That Has an Access Key and Text Wrapping
This example shows how to create a control that has an access key and supports text wrapping. The example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> control to illustrate these concepts.  
  
## Example  
 **Add Text Wrapping to Your Label**  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> control does not support text wrapping. If you need a label that wraps across multiple lines, you can nest another element that does support text wrapping and put the element inside the label. The following example shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> to make a label that wraps several lines of text.

 **Add an Access Key and Text Wrapping to Your Label**  
  
 If you need a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> that has an access key (mnemonic), use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.AccessText> element that is inside the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label>.  
  
 Controls such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TabItem>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GroupBox> have default control templates. These templates contain a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentPresenter>. One of the properties that you can set on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentPresenter> is <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentPresenter.RecognizesAccessKey%2A>="true", which you can use to specify an access key for the control.  
  
 The following example shows how to create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> that has an access key and supports text wrapping. To enable text wrapping, the example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.AccessText.TextWrapping%2A> property and uses an underline character to specify the access key. (The character that immediately follows the underline character is the access key.)
