# Button

A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control reacts to user input from a mouse, keyboard, stylus, or other input device and raises a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event. A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is a basic user interface (UI) component that can contain simple content, such as text, and can also contain complex content, such as images and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> controls.
