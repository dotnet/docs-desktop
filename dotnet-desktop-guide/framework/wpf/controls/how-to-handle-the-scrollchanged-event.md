# How to: Handle the ScrollChanged Event

## Example  

 This example shows how to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.ScrollChanged> event of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument> element with <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Paragraph> parts is defined in XAML. When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.ScrollChanged> event occurs due to user interaction, a handler is invoked, and text is written to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> indicating that the event has occurred.
