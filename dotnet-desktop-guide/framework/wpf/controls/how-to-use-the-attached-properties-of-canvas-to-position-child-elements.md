# How to: Use the Attached Properties of Canvas to Position Child Elements
This example shows how to use the attached properties of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to position child elements.  
  
## Example  
 The following example adds four <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements as child elements of a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>. Each element is represented by a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Bottom%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Left%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Right%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Top%2A>.
 Each <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is positioned relative to the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> and according to its assigned property value.
