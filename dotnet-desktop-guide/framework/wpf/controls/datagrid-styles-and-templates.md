# DataGrid Styles and Templates

This topic describes the styles and templates for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control. You can modify the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> to give the control a unique appearance. For more information, see [Create a template for a control](how-to-create-apply-template.md).  
  
## DataGrid Parts  

 The following table lists the named parts for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control.  
  
|Part|Type|Description|  
|-|-|-|  
|PART_ColumnHeadersPresenter|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.DataGridColumnHeadersPresenter>|The row that contains the column headers.|  
  
 When you create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> for a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>, your template might contain an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsPresenter> within a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>. (The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsPresenter> displays each item in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>; the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> enables scrolling within the control).  If the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsPresenter> is not the direct child of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>, you must give the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsPresenter> the name, `ItemsPresenter`.  
  
 The default template for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control. For more information about the parts defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>, see [ScrollViewer Styles and Templates](scrollviewer-styles-and-templates.md).
