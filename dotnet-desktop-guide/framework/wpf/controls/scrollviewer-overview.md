# ScrollViewer Overview

Content within a user interface is often larger than a computer screen's display area. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control provides a convenient way to enable scrolling of content in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. This topic introduces the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> element and provides several usage examples.  
  
<a name="what_is_a_scrollviewer_element"></a>

## The ScrollViewer Control  

 There are two predefined elements that enable scrolling in WPF applications: <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control encapsulates horizontal and vertical <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> elements and a content container (such as a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element) in order to display other visible elements in a scrollable area. You must build a custom object in order to use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> element for content scrolling. However, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> element by itself because it is a composite control that encapsulates <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> functionality.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control responds to both mouse and keyboard commands, and defines numerous methods with which to scroll content by predetermined increments. You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.ScrollChanged> event to detect a change in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> state.  
  
 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> can only have one child, typically a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element that can host a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection of elements. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentPresenter.Content%2A> property defines the sole child of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>.

## Physical vs. Logical Scrolling  

 Physical scrolling is used to scroll content by a predetermined physical increment, typically by a value that is declared in pixels. Logical scrolling is used to scroll to the next item in the logical tree. Physical scrolling is the default scroll behavior for most <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements. WPF supports both types of scrolling.  
  
#### The IScrollInfo Interface  

 The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo> interface represents the main scrolling region within a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> or derived control. The interface defines scrolling properties and methods that can be implemented by <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements that require scrolling by logical unit, rather than by a physical increment. Casting an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo> to a derived <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> and then using its scrolling methods provides a useful way to scroll to the next logical unit in a child collection, rather than by pixel increment. By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> control supports scrolling by physical units.  
  
 <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel> both implement <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo> and natively support logical scrolling. For layout controls that natively support logical scrolling, you can still achieve physical scrolling by wrapping the host <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> and setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll%2A> property to `false`.  
  
 The following code example demonstrates how to cast an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo> to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> and use content scrolling methods (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo.LineUp%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.IScrollInfo.LineDown%2A>) defined by the interface.

## Defining and Using a ScrollViewer Element  

 The following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> in a window that contains some text and a rectangle. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> elements appear only when they are necessary. When you resize the window, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar> elements appear and disappear, due to updated values of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.ComputedHorizontalScrollBarVisibility%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer.ComputedVerticalScrollBarVisibility%2A> properties.

## Styling a ScrollViewer  

 Like all controls in Windows Presentation Foundation, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> can be styled in order to change the default rendering behavior of the control. For additional information on control styling, see [Styling and Templating](styles-templates-overview.md).

## Paginating Documents  

 For document content, an alternative to scrolling is to choose a document container that supports pagination. <xref:System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument> is for documents that are designed to be hosted within a viewing control, such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentPageViewer>, that supports paginating content across multiple pages, preventing the need for scrolling. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DocumentViewer> provides a solution for viewing <xref:System.Windows.Documents.FixedDocument> content, which uses traditional scrolling to display content outside the realm of the display area.  
  
 For additional information about document formats and presentation options, see [Documents in WPF](../advanced/documents-in-wpf.md).
