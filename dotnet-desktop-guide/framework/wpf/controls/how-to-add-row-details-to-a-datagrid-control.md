# How to: Add Row Details to a DataGrid Control

When using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control, you can customize the data presentation by adding a row details section. Adding a row details section enables you to group some data in a template that is optionally visible or collapsed. For example, you can add row details to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> that presents only a summary of the data for each row in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>, but presents more data fields when the user selects a row. You define the template for the row details section in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> property. The following illustration shows an example of a row details section.

 You define the row details template as either inline XAML or as a resource. Both approaches are shown in the following procedures. A data template that is added as a resource can be used throughout the project without re-creating the template. A data template that is added as inline XAML is only accessible from the control where it is defined.  
  
### To display row details by using inline XAML  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> that displays data from a data source.  
  
2. In the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> element, add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> element.  
  
3. Create a <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> that defines the appearance of the row details section.  
  
     The following XAML shows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> and how to define the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> inline. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> displays three values in each row and three more values when the row is selected.

     The following code shows the query that is used to select the data that is displayed in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>. In this example, the query selects data from an entity that contains customer information.

     [!code-vb[DataGrid_RowDetails#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/datagrid_rowdetails/vb/mainwindow.xaml.vb#2)]  
  
### To display row details by using a resource  
  
1. Create a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> that displays data from a data source.  
  
2. Add a <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Resources%2A> element to the root element, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Window> control or a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> control, or add a <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> element to the <xref:System.Windows.Application> class in the App.xaml (or Application.xaml) file.  
  
3. In the resources element, create a <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> that defines the appearance of the row details section.  
  
     The following XAML shows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Application> class.  
  
     [!code-xaml[DataGrid_RowDetails#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/datagrid_rowdetails/cs/app.xaml#3)]  
  
4. On the <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate>, set the [x:Key Directive](/dotnet/desktop/xaml-services/xkey-directive) to a value that uniquely identifies the data template.  
  
5. In the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> element, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> property to the resource defined in the previous steps. Assign the resource as a static resource.  
  
     The following XAML shows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate%2A> property set to the resource from the previous example.  
  
     [!code-xaml[DataGrid_RowDetails#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/datagrid_rowdetails/cs/window2.xaml#4)]  
  
### To set visibility and prevent horizontal scrolling for row details  
  
1. If needed, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.RowDetailsVisibilityMode%2A> property to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridRowDetailsVisibilityMode> value.  
  
     By default, the value is set to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridRowDetailsVisibilityMode.VisibleWhenSelected>. You can set it to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridRowDetailsVisibilityMode.Visible> to show the details for all of the rows or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridRowDetailsVisibilityMode.Collapsed> to hide the details for all rows.  
  
2. If needed, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.AreRowDetailsFrozen%2A> property to `true` to prevent the row details section from scrolling horizontally.
