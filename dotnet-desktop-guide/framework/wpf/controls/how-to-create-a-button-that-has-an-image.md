# How to: Create a Button That Has an Image
This example shows how to include an image on a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  
  
## Example  
 The following example creates two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls. One <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> contains text and the other contains an image. The image is in a folder called data, which is a subfolder of the exampleâ€™s project folder. When a user clicks the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> that has the image, the background and the text of the other <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> change.  
  
 This example creates <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls by using markup but uses code to write the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event handlers.
