# How to: Resize Rows with a GridSplitter
This example shows how to use a horizontal <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> to redistribute the space between two rows in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> without changing the dimensions of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  
  
## Example  
 **How to create a GridSplitter that overlays the edge of a row**  
  
 To specify a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that resizes adjacent rows in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.Row%2A> attached property to one of the rows that you want to resize. If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one column, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> attached property to specify the number of columns. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top> or <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Bottom> (which alignment you set depends on which two rows you want to resize). Finally, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Stretch>.  
  
 The following example shows how to define a horizontal <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that resizes adjacent rows.

 A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that does not occupy its own row may be obscured by other controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>. For more information about how to prevent this issue, see [Make Sure That a GridSplitter Is Visible](how-to-make-sure-that-a-gridsplitter-is-visible.md).  
  
 **How to create a GridSplitter that occupies a row**  
  
 To specify a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that occupies a row in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.Row%2A> attached property to one of the rows that you want to resize. If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one column, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> attached property to the number of columns. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Center>, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Stretch>, and set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition.Height%2A> of the row that contains the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> to <xref:System.Windows.GridLength.Auto%2A>.  
  
 The following example shows how to define a horizontal <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that occupies a row and resizes the rows on either side of it.
