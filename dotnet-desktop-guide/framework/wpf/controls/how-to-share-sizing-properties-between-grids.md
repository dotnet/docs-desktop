# How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids
This example shows how to share the sizing data of columns and rows between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements in order to keep sizing consistent.  
  
## Example  
 The following example introduces two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements as child elements of a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> attached property of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is defined on the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>.  
  
 The example manipulates the property value by using two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements; each element represents one of the Boolean property values. When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> property value is set to `true`, each column or row member of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DefinitionBase.SharedSizeGroup%2A> shares sizing information, regardless of the content of a row or column.

 The following code-behind example handles the methods that the button <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event raises. The example writes the results of these method calls to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements that use related get methods to output the new property values as strings.
