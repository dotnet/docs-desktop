# How to: Create a Grid Element

## Example  

 The following example shows how to create and use an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> by using either Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) or code. This example uses three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition> objects and three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition> objects to create a grid that has nine cells, such as in a worksheet. Each cell contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element that represents data, and the top row contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> property applied. To show the boundaries of each cell, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ShowGridLines%2A> property is enabled.

  Either approach will generate a user interface that looks much the same, like the one below.

  ![a screenshot depicts a WPF user interface which contains a grid broken into three columns.  It bears the heading '2018 Products Shipped' spanning all columns of the top row, and has three columns each with sales figures for a certain quarter.  The bottom row has text spanning two columns with the message 'Total Units: 300,000'](././media/how-to-create-a-grid-element/how-to-create-a-grid-element.png)
