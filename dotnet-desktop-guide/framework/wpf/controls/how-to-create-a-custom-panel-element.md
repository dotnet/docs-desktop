# How to: Create a Custom Panel Element
## Example  
 This example shows how to override the default layout behavior of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element and create custom layout elements that are derived from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>.  
  
 The example defines a simple custom <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element called `PlotPanel`, which positions child elements according to two hard-coded x- and y-coordinates. In this example, `x` and `y` are both set to `50`; therefore, all child elements are positioned at that location on the x and y axes.  
  
 To implement custom <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> behaviors, the example uses the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> methods. Each method returns the <xref:System.Windows.Size> data that is necessary to position and render child elements.
