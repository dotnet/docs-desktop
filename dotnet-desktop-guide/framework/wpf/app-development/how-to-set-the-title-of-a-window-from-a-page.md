# How to: Set the Title of a Window from a Page
This example shows how to set the title of the window in which a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted.  
  
## Example  
 A page can change the title of the window that is hosting it by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.WindowTitle%2A> property, like so:  
  
 [!code-xaml[HOWTONavigationSnippets#SetPageWindowTitleXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTONavigationSnippets/CSharp/SetWindowTitlePage.xaml#setpagewindowtitlexaml)]  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.Title%2A> property of a page does not change the value of the window title. Instead, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.Title%2A> specifies the name of a page entry in navigation history.
