sections:
  - name: Support for XBAPs
    questions:
      - question: What is the current level of support Microsoft provides for XBAPs?
        answer: XBAPs are supported with .NET Framework. WPF for .NET doesn't include XBAP support.

      - question: Are there any supported browsers that natively support XBAP?
        answer: |
          Not exactly, there are no longer any supported browsers that were designed for XBAP. Support for
          Internet Explorer 11 ended on June 15, 2022. Some browsers, such as Microsoft Edge and
          Google Chrome, have an Internet Explorer Mode (IE Mode) feature that adds legacy Internet
          Explorer support. These modes weren't designed for XBAPs, so some XBAP features might not work.
          For more information, see [What is Internet Explorer (IE) mode](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode).

      - question: How do I run my XBAP?
        answer: |
          XBAPs must be deployed to a web server and you must use a browser with Internet Explorer Mode (IE Mode)
          compatibility. You might be required to configure local policy to enable your app in the
          appropriate IE security zone. For more information, see [What is Internet Explorer (IE) mode](/deployedge/edge-ie-mode)
          and [Set up Legacy Browser Support for Microsoft Edge in IE mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/10368106).
          

  - name: Migration options
    questions:
      - question: Can I convert my XBAP to a WPF application?
        answer: Yes. You can migrate your app to a standard WPF application and deploy your app to the web with Click-Once.

      - question: I need to run in a browser, what are my options?
        answer: |
          - **ASP.NET Core using Blazor and WebAssembly**

            Blazor is a full stack web app that uses C#. Depending how well organized and compartmentalized your code is, you
            might have to rewrite the front-end of your app in Blazor. Blazor apps can be deployed using WebAssembly, which lets
            the app run fully client-side in the browser.

            For more information, see [What is Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor).

          - **.NET MAUI**

            If you created your app as an XBAP so that it could run on non-Windows operating systems, try converting your app to
            .NET MAUI, which also uses XAML for its UI. .NET MAUI is different from WPF, although they share many similar concepts.
            For more information, see [What is .NET MAUI](/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui).

          - **OpenSilver**

            The OpenSilver project was created as an alternative to Silverlight. Silverlight was a subset of WPF that was discontinued long ago.
            Your XBAP project might convert well to OpenSilver. For more information, see the [OpenSilver website](https://opensilver.net/) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenSilver/OpenSilver).
