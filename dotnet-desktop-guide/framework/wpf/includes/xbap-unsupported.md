>[!WARNING]
> XBAPs require legacy browsers to operate, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. These older browser versions are usually unsupported on Windows 10 and Windows 11. Modern browsers no longer support the technology required for XBAP apps due to security risks. Plugins that enable XBAPs are no longer supported. For more information, see [Frequently asked questions about WPF browser-hosted applications (XBAP)](../app-development/xbap-faq.yml).
