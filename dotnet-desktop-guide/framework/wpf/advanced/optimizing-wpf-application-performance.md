# Optimizing WPF Application Performance

This section is intended as a reference for WPF, you should first familiarize yourself with both platforms. This section assumes working knowledge of both, and is written for programmers who already know enough to get their applications up and running.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> The performance data provided in this section are based on WPF applications running on a 2.8 GHz PC with 512 RAM and an ATI Radeon 9700 graphics card.
