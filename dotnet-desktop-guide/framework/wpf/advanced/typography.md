# Typography
[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] includes support for rich presentation of text content. Text in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] is rendered using Microsoft ClearType, which enhances the clarity and readability of text. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] also supports OpenType fonts, which provide additional capabilities beyond those defined by the TrueTypeÂ® format.
