# How to: Make a UIElement Transparent or Semi-Transparent
This example shows how to make a <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> transparent or semi-transparent. To make an element transparent or semi-transparent, you set its <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property. A value of `0.0` makes the element completely transparent, while a value of `1.0` makes the element completely opaque. A value of `0.5` makes the element 50% opaque, and so on. An element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> is set to `1.0` by default.  
  
## Example  
 The following example sets the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> of a button to `0.25`, making it and its contents (in this case, the button's text) 25% opaque.

 If an element's contents have their own <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> settings, those values are multiplied against the containing elements <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A>.  
  
 The following example sets a button's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> to `0.25`, and the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> of an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control contained with in the button to `0.5`. As a result, the image appears 12.5% opaque: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125.

 Another way to control the opacity of an element is to set the opacity of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> that paints the element. This approach enables you to selectively alter the opacity of portions of an element, and provides performance benefits over using the element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property. The following example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush.Opacity%2A> of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush> used to paint the button's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> is set to `0.25`. As a result, the brush's background is 25% opaque, but its contents (the button's text) remain 100% opaque.

 You may also control the opacity of individual colors within a brush. For more information about colors and brushes, see [Painting with Solid Colors and Gradients Overview](../graphics-multimedia/painting-with-solid-colors-and-gradients-overview.md). For an example showing how to animate an element's opacity, see [Animate the Opacity of an Element or Brush](../graphics-multimedia/how-to-animate-the-opacity-of-an-element-or-brush.md).
