# How to: Erase Ink on a Custom Control
The <xref:System.Windows.Ink.IncrementalStrokeHitTester> determines whether the currently drawn stroke intersects another stroke.  This is useful for creating a control that enables a user to erase parts of a stroke, the way a user can on an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> when the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.EditingMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvasEditingMode.EraseByPoint>.  
  
## Example  
 The following example creates a custom control that enables the user to erase parts of strokes.  This example creates a control that contains ink when it is initialized.  To create a control that collects ink, see [Creating an Ink Input Control](creating-an-ink-input-control.md).
