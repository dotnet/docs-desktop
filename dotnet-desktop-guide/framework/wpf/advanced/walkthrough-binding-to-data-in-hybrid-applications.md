# Walkthrough: Binding to Data in Hybrid Applications

Binding a data source to a control is essential for providing users with access to underlying data, whether you are using Windows Forms or [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. This walkthrough shows how you can use data binding in hybrid applications that include both Windows Forms and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls.

Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:

- Creating the project.

- Defining the data template.

- Specifying the form layout.

- Specifying data bindings.

- Displaying data by using interoperation.

- Adding the data source to the project.

- Binding to the data source.

For a complete code listing of the tasks illustrated in this walkthrough, see [Data Binding in Hybrid Applications Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples/tree/master/Migration%20and%20Interoperability/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding).

When you are finished, you will have an understanding of data binding features in hybrid applications.

## Prerequisites

You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- Visual Studio.

- Access to the Northwind sample database running on Microsoft SQL Server.

## Creating the Project

### To create and set up the project

1. Create a WPF Application project named `WPFWithWFAndDatabinding`.

2. In Solution Explorer, add references to the following assemblies.

    - WindowsFormsIntegration

    - System.Windows.Forms

3. Open MainWindow.xaml in the WPF Designer.

4. In the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element, add the following Windows Forms namespaces mapping.

    ```xaml
    xmlns:wf="clr-namespace:System.Windows.Forms;assembly=System.Windows.Forms"
    ```

5. Name the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element `mainGrid` by assigning the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#8)]

## Defining the Data Template

The master list of customers is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The following code example defines a <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> object named `ListItemsTemplate` that controls the visual tree of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. This <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> is assigned to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemTemplate%2A> property.

### To define the data template

- Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#3)]

## Specifying the Form Layout

The layout of the form is defined by a grid with three rows and three columns. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> controls are provided to identify each column in the Customers table.

### To set up the Grid layout

- Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#4)]

### To set up the Label controls

- Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#5)]

## Specifying Data Bindings

The master list of customers is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The attached `ListItemsTemplate` binds a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control to the `ContactName` field from the database.

The details of each customer record are displayed in several <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls.

### To specify data bindings

- Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.

     The <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> class binds the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls to the appropriate fields in the database.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#6)]

## Displaying Data by Using Interoperation

The orders corresponding to the selected customer are displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView?displayProperty=nameWithType> control named `dataGridView1`. The `dataGridView1` control is bound to the data source in the code-behind file. A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control is the parent of this Windows Forms control.

### To display data in the DataGridView control

- Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.

     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#7)]

## Adding the Data Source to the Project

With Visual Studio, you can easily add a data source to your project. This procedure adds a strongly typed data set to your project. Several other support classes, such as table adapters for each of the chosen tables, are also added.

### To add the data source

1. From the **Data** menu, select **Add New Data Source**.

2. In the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, create a connection to the Northwind database by using a dataset. For more information, see [How to: Connect to Data in a Database](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/fxk9yw1t(v=vs.120)).

3. When you are prompted by the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, save the connection string as `NorthwindConnectionString`.

4. When you are prompted to choose your database objects, select the `Customers` and `Orders` tables, and name the generated data set `NorthwindDataSet`.

## Binding to the Data Source

The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource?displayProperty=nameWithType> component provides a uniform interface for the application's data source. Binding to the data source is implemented in the code-behind file.

### To bind to the data source

1. Open the code-behind file, which is named MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs.

2. Copy the following code into the `MainWindow` class definition.

     This code declares the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component and associated helper classes that connect to the database.

     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#11)]
     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#11)]

3. Copy the following code into the constructor.

     This code creates and initializes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.

     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#12)]
     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#12)]

4. Open MainWindow.xaml.

5. In Design view or XAML view, select the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element.

6. In the Properties window, click the **Events** tab.

7. Double-click the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.

8. Copy the following code into the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler.

     This code assigns the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component as the data context and populates the `Customers` and `Orders` adapter objects.

     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#13)]
     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#13)]

9. Copy the following code into the `MainWindow` class definition.

     This method handles the <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionView.CurrentChanged> event and updates the current item of the data binding.

     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#14)]
     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#14)]

10. Press F5 to build and run the application.
