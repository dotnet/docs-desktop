# How to: Add an Owner Type for a Dependency Property

This example shows how to add a class as an owner of a dependency property registered for a different type. By doing this, the WPF XAML reader and property system are both able to recognize the class as an additional owner of the property. Adding as owner optionally allows the adding class to provide type-specific metadata.  
  
 In the following example, `StateProperty` is a property registered by the `MyStateControl` class. The class `UnrelatedStateControl` adds itself as an owner of the `StateProperty` using the <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty.AddOwner%2A> method, specifically using the signature that allows for new metadata for the dependency property as it exists on the adding type. Notice that you should provide common language runtime (CLR) accessors for the property similar to the example shown in the [Implement a Dependency Property](how-to-implement-a-dependency-property.md) example, as well as re-expose the dependency property identifier on the class being added as owner.  
  
 Without wrappers, the dependency property would still work from the perspective of programmatic access using <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.GetValue%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.DependencyObject.SetValue%2A>. But you typically want to parallel this property-system behavior with the CLR property wrappers. The wrappers make it easier to set the dependency property programmatically, and make it possible to set the properties as XAML attributes.
