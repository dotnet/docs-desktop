# Disable the RealTimeStylus for WPF Applications

Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) has built in support for processing Windows 7 touch input. The support comes through the tablet platformâ€™s real-time stylus input as <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnStylusDown%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnStylusUp%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.OnStylusMove%2A> events. Windows 7 also provides multi-touch input as Win32 WM_TOUCH window messages. These two APIs are mutually exclusive on the same HWND. Enabling touch input via the tablet platform (the default for WPF applications) disables WM_TOUCH messages. As a result, to use WM_TOUCH to receive touch messages from a WPF window, you must disable the built-in stylus support in WPF. This is applicable in a scenario such as a WPF window hosting a component that uses WM_TOUCH.  
  
 To disable WPF listening to stylus input, remove any tablet support added by the WPF window.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code shows how to remove the default tablet platform support by using reflection.  
  
```csharp  
public static void DisableWPFTabletSupport()  
{  
    // Get a collection of the tablet devices for this window.
    TabletDeviceCollection devices = System.Windows.Input.Tablet.TabletDevices;  
  
    if (devices.Count > 0)  
    {
        // Get the Type of InputManager.  
        Type inputManagerType = typeof(System.Windows.Input.InputManager);  
  
        // Call the StylusLogic method on the InputManager.Current instance.  
        object stylusLogic = inputManagerType.InvokeMember("StylusLogic",  
                    BindingFlags.GetProperty | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic,  
                    null, InputManager.Current, null);  
  
        if (stylusLogic != null)  
        {  
            //  Get the type of the stylusLogic returned from the call to StylusLogic.  
            Type stylusLogicType = stylusLogic.GetType();  
  
            // Loop until there are no more devices to remove.  
            while (devices.Count > 0)  
            {  
                // Remove the first tablet device in the devices collection.  
                stylusLogicType.InvokeMember("OnTabletRemoved",  
                        BindingFlags.InvokeMethod | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic,  
                        null, stylusLogic, new object[] { (uint)0 });  
            }
        }  
  
    }  
}  
```
