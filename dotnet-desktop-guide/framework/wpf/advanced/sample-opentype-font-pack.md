The sample fonts are supplied under license from Ascender Corporation. These fonts implement only a subset of the total features defined by the OpenType format. The following table lists the names of the sample OpenType fonts.

## Installing the Fonts  

 You have the option of installing the sample OpenType fonts to the default Windows Fonts directory, **\WINDOWS\Fonts**. Use the Fonts control panel to install the fonts. Once these fonts are on your computer, they are accessible to all applications that reference default Windows fonts. You can display a representative set of characters in several font sizes by doubling-clicking the font file. The following screenshot shows the Lindsey font file, Linds.ttf.

## Using the Fonts  

 There are two ways that you can use fonts in your application. You can add fonts to your application as project content items that are not embedded as resources within an assembly. Alternatively, you can add fonts to your application as project resource items that are embedded within the application's assembly files. For more information, see [Packaging Fonts with Applications](packaging-fonts-with-applications.md).
