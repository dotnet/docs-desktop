# Advanced Ink Handling

The WPF ships with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>, and is an element you can put in your application to immediately start collecting and displaying ink. However, if the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> control does not provide a fine enough level of control, you can maintain control at a higher level by customizing your own ink collection and ink rendering classes using <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns> classes provide a mechanism for implementing low-level control over <xref:System.Windows.Input.Stylus> input and dynamically rendering ink. The <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns.StylusPlugIn> class provides a mechanism for you to implement custom behavior and apply it to the stream of data coming from the stylus device for optimal performance. The <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns.DynamicRenderer>, a specialized <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns.StylusPlugIn>, allows you to customize dynamically rendering ink data in real-time which means that the <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPlugIns.DynamicRenderer> draws digital ink immediately as <xref:System.Windows.Input.StylusPoint> data is generated, so it appears to "flow" from the stylus device.
