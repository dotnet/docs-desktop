# How to: Make an Object Follow the Mouse Pointer
This example shows how to change the dimensions of an object when the mouse pointer moves on the screen.  
  
 The example includes an [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file that creates the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] and a code-behind file that creates the event handler.  
  
## Example  
 The following XAML creates the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], which consists of an <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> inside of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>, and attaches the event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove> event.  
  
 [!code-xaml[mouseMoveWithPointer#MouseMoveWithPointerXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseMoveWithPointer/CSharp/Window1.xaml#mousemovewithpointerxaml)]  
  
 The following code behind creates the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseMove> event handler.  When the mouse pointer moves, the height and the width of the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> are increased and decreased.
