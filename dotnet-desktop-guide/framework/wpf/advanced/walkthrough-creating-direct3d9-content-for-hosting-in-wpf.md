# Walkthrough: Creating Direct3D9 Content for Hosting in WPF
This walkthrough shows how to create Direct3D9 content that is suitable for hosting in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. For more information on hosting Direct3D9 content in WPF applications, see [WPF and Direct3D9 Interoperation](wpf-and-direct3d9-interoperation.md).

 In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:

- Create a Direct3D9 project.

- Configure the Direct3D9 project for hosting in a WPF application.

 When you are finished, you will have a DLL that contains Direct3D9 content for use in a WPF application.

## Prerequisites
 You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:

- Visual Studio 2010.

- DirectX SDK 9 or later.

## Creating the Direct3D9 Project
 The first step is to create and configure the Direct3D9 project.

#### To create the Direct3D9 project

1. Create a new Win32 Project in C++ named `D3DContent`.

     The Win32 Application Wizard opens and displays the Welcome screen.

2. Click **Next**.

     The Application Settings screen appears.

3. In the **Application type:** section, select the **DLL** option.

4. Click **Finish**.

     The D3DContent project is generated.

5. In Solution Explorer, right-click the D3DContent project and select **Properties**.

     The **D3DContent Property Pages** dialog box opens.

6. Select the **C/C++** node.

7. In the **Additional Include Directories** field, specify the location of the DirectX include folder. The default location for this folder is %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft DirectX SDK (*version*)\Include.

8. Double-click the **Linker** node to expand it.

9. In the **Additional Library Directories** field, specify the location of the DirectX libraries folder. The default location for this folder is %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft DirectX SDK (*version*)\Lib\x86.

10. Select the **Input** node.

11. In the **Additional Dependencies** field, add the `d3d9.lib` and `d3dx9.lib` files.

12. In Solution Explorer, add a new module definition file (.def) named `D3DContent.def` to the project.

## Creating the Direct3D9 Content
 To get the best performance, your Direct3D9 content must use particular settings. The following code shows how to create a Direct3D9 surface that has the best performance characteristics. For more information, see [Performance Considerations for Direct3D9 and WPF Interoperability](performance-considerations-for-direct3d9-and-wpf-interoperability.md).

#### To create the Direct3D9 content

1. Using Solution Explorer, add three C++ classes to the project named the following.

     `CRenderer` (with virtual destructor)

     `CRendererManager`

     `CTriangleRenderer`

2. Open Renderer.h in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#RendererH](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/renderer.h#rendererh)]

3. Open Renderer.cpp in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#RendererCPP](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/renderer.cpp#renderercpp)]

4. Open RendererManager.h in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#RendererManagerH](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/renderermanager.h#renderermanagerh)]

5. Open RendererManager.cpp in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#RendererManagerCPP](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/renderermanager.cpp#renderermanagercpp)]

6. Open TriangleRenderer.h in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#TriangleRendererH](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/trianglerenderer.h#trianglerendererh)]

7. Open TriangleRenderer.cpp in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#TriangleRendererCPP](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/trianglerenderer.cpp#trianglerenderercpp)]

8. Open stdafx.h in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#StdafxH](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/stdafx.h#stdafxh)]

9. Open dllmain.cpp in the Code Editor and replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#DllMain](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/cpp/dllmain.cpp#dllmain)]

10. Open D3DContent.def in the code editor.

11. Replace the automatically generated code with the following code.

    ```cpp
    LIBRARY "D3DContent"

    EXPORTS

    SetSize
    SetAlpha
    SetNumDesiredSamples
    SetAdapter

    GetBackBufferNoRef
    Render
    Destroy
    ```

12. Build the project.

## Next Steps

- Host the Direct3D9 content in a WPF application. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Hosting Direct3D9 Content in WPF](walkthrough-hosting-direct3d9-content-in-wpf.md).
