# How to: Use System Fonts Keys

System resources expose a number of system metrics as resources to help developers create visuals that are consistent with system settings. <xref:System.Windows.SystemFonts> is a class that contains both system font values and system font resources that bind to the valuesâ€”for example, <xref:System.Windows.SystemFonts.CaptionFontFamily%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.SystemFonts.CaptionFontFamilyKey%2A>.  
  
 System font metrics can be used as either static or dynamic resources. Use a dynamic resource if you want the font metric to update automatically while the application runs; otherwise use a static resource.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic resources have the keyword *Key* appended to the property name.  
  
 The following example shows how to access and use system font dynamic resources to style or customize a button. This XAML example creates a button style that assigns <xref:System.Windows.SystemFonts> values to a button.
