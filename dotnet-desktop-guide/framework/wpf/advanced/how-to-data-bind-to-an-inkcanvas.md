# How to: Data Bind to an InkCanvas
## Example  
 The following example demonstrates how to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.Strokes%2A> property of an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> to another <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>.  
  
 [!code-xaml[InkCanvasBindingSnippet#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasBindingSnippet/CS/Window2.xaml#2)]  
  
 The following example demonstrates how to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> property to a data source.

[!code-xaml[InkCanvasBindingSnippet#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasBindingSnippet/CS/Window2.xaml#4)]  
  
 The following example declares two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> objects in XAML and establishes data binding between them and other data sources.  The first <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>, called `ic`, is bound to two data sources.  The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.EditingMode%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> properties on `ic` are bound to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> objects, which are in turn bound to arrays defined in the XAML.  The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.EditingMode%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.Strokes%2A> properties of the second <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> are bound to the first <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>, `ic`.
