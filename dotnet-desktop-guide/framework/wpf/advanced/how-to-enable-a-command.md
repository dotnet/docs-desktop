# How to: Enable a Command

The following example demonstrates how to use commanding in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).  The example shows how to associate a <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand> to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, create a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding>, and create the event handlers which implement the <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand>.  For more information on commanding, see the [Commanding Overview](commanding-overview.md).  
  
## Example  

 The first section of code creates the user interface (UI), which consists of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> and a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>, and creates a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> that associates the command handlers with the <xref:System.Windows.Input.RoutedCommand>.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Input.ICommandSource.Command%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is associated with the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Close%2A> command.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBindingCollection> of the root <xref:System.Windows.Window>. The <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.Executed> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.CanExecute> event handlers are attached to this binding and associated with the <xref:System.Windows.Input.ApplicationCommands.Close%2A> command.  
  
 Without the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> there is no command logic, only a mechanism to invoke the command.  When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is clicked, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.PreviewExecuted> <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent> is raised on the command target followed by the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.Executed> <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent>.  These events traverse the element tree looking for a <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> for that particular command.  It is worth noting that because <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent> tunnel and bubble through the element tree, care must be taken in where the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> is put.   If the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> is on a sibling of the command target or another node that is not on the route of the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEvent>, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding> will not be accessed.

 [!code-vb[EnableCloseCommand#CloseCommandBindingCodeBehind](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/EnableCloseCommand/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#closecommandbindingcodebehind)]  
  
 The next section of code implements the <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.Executed> and <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.CanExecute> event handlers.  
  
 The <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandManager.Executed> handler calls a method to close the open file.  The <xref:System.Windows.Input.CommandBinding.CanExecute> handler calls a method to determine whether a file is open.  If a file is open, <xref:System.Windows.Input.CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs.CanExecute%2A> is set to `true`; otherwise, it is set to `false`.
