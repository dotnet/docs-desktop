# How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout
This example describes how to use a grid in the automatic layout approach to creating a localizable application.  
  
 Localization of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process. Often localizers need to re-size and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called `auto layout`.  
  
 The following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text. Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to `Auto`; therefore the cell that contains the button with an image adjusts to fit the image. Because the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element can adjust to its content it can be useful when taking the automatic layout approach to designing applications that can be localized.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to use a grid.
