> [!WARNING]
> Code Access Security (CAS) is not supported by modern .NET, it's a .NET Framework-only concept. All CAS-related functionality is treated under the assumption of full-trust. For more information, see [Differences with WPF .NET - Code Access Security](../migration/differences-from-net-framework.md#code-access-security).
