# Panel

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements are components that control the rendering of elements—their size and dimensions, their position, and the arrangement of their child content. The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) provides a number of predefined <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements as well as the ability to construct custom <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements.

## Styles and templates

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> is an abstract base class that doesn't define a default template or visual appearance. Derived panel classes implement their own styling and template behavior.

### Content property

This control uses the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> property as its content property.

### Parts

This control doesn't define any template parts.

### Visual states

This control doesn't define any visual states.

## The Panel class

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> is the base class for all elements that provide layout support in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Derived <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements are used to position and arrange elements in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) and code.

The WPF includes a comprehensive suite of derived panel implementations that enable many complex layouts. These derived classes expose properties and methods that enable most standard user interface (UI) scenarios. Developers who can't find a child arrangement behavior that meets their needs can create new layouts by overriding the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.MeasureOverride%2A> methods.

## Panel common members

All <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements support the base sizing and positioning properties defined by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, including <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.LayoutTransform%2A>. For additional information on positioning properties defined by <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, see [Alignment, Margins, and Padding Overview](../advanced/alignment-margins-and-padding-overview.md).

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> exposes additional properties that are of critical importance in understanding and using layout. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Background%2A> property is used to fill the area between the boundaries of a derived panel element with a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush>. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> represents the child collection of elements that the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> is comprised of. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.InternalChildren%2A> represents the content of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection plus those members generated by data binding. Both consist of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UIElementCollection> of child elements hosted within the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>.

Panel also exposes a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndex%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> attached property that can be used to achieve layered order in a derived <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>. Members of a panel's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection with a higher <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndex%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> value appear in front of those with a lower <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndex%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> value. This is particularly useful for panels such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> that allow children to share the same coordinate space.

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> also defines the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.OnRender%2A> method, which can be used to override the default presentation behavior of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>.

### Attached properties

Derived panel elements make extensive use of attached properties. An attached property is a specialized form of dependency property that doesn't have the conventional common language runtime (CLR) property "wrapper". Attached properties have a specialized syntax in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), which can be seen in several of the examples that follow.

One purpose of an attached property is to allow child elements to store unique values of a property that is actually defined by a parent element. An application of this functionality is having child elements inform the parent how they wish to be presented in the user interface (UI), which is extremely useful for application layout. For more information, see [Attached Properties Overview](../properties/attached-properties-overview.md).

## Derived Panel elements

Many objects derive from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>, but not all of them are intended for use as root layout providers. There are six defined panel classes (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>) that are designed specifically for creating application UI.

Each panel element encapsulates its own special functionality, as seen in the following table.

|Element Name|UI Panel?|Description|
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>|Yes|Defines an area within which you can explicitly position child elements by coordinates relative to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> area.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>|Yes|Defines an area within which you can arrange child elements either horizontally or vertically, relative to each other.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>|Yes|Defines a flexible grid area consisting of columns and rows. Child elements of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> can be positioned precisely using the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>|Yes|Arranges child elements into a single line that can be oriented horizontally or vertically.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TabPanel>|No|Handles the layout of tab buttons in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TabControl>.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ToolBarOverflowPanel>|No|Arranges content within a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolBar> control.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.UniformGrid>|No|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.UniformGrid> is used to arrange children in a grid with all equal cell sizes.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingPanel>|No|Provides a base class for panels that can "virtualize" their children collection.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel>|Yes|Arranges and virtualizes content on a single line oriented horizontally or vertically.|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>|Yes|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel> positions child elements in sequential position from left to right, breaking content to the next line at the edge of the containing box. Subsequent ordering happens sequentially from top to bottom or right to left, depending on the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel.Orientation%2A> property.|

## User Interface panels

There are six panel classes available in WPF that are optimized to support UI scenarios: <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>. These panel elements are easy to use, versatile, and extensible enough for most applications.

Each derived <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> element treats sizing constraints differently. Understanding how a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> handles constraints in either the horizontal or vertical direction can make layout more predictable.

|**Panel Name**|**x-Dimension**|**y-Dimension**|
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>|Constrained to content|Constrained to content|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>|Constrained|Constrained|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> (Vertical Orientation)|Constrained|Constrained to content|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> (Horizontal Orientation)|Constrained to content|Constrained|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>|Constrained|Constrained, except in cases where <xref:System.Windows.GridUnitType.Auto> apply to rows and columns|
|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>|Constrained to content|Constrained to content|

More detailed descriptions and usage examples of each of these elements can be found below.

### Canvas

The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> element enables positioning of content according to absolute *x-* and *y-* coordinates. Elements can be drawn in a unique location; or, if elements occupy the same coordinates, the order in which they appear in markup determines the order in which the elements are drawn.

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> provides the most flexible layout support of any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>. Height and Width properties are used to define the area of the canvas, and elements inside are assigned absolute coordinates relative to the area of the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>. Four attached properties, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Left%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Top%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Right%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas.Bottom%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, allow fine control of object placement within a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>, allowing the developer to position and arrange elements precisely on the screen.

#### ClipToBounds within a Canvas

<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> can position child elements at any position on the screen, even at coordinates that are outside of its own defined <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A>. Furthermore, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> isn't affected by the size of its children. As a result, it's possible for a child element to overdraw other elements outside the bounding rectangle of the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>. The default behavior of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> is to allow children to be drawn outside the bounds of the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>. If this behavior is undesirable, the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.ClipToBounds%2A> property can be set to `true`. This causes <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to clip to its own size. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> is the only layout element that allows children to be drawn outside its bounds.

This behavior is graphically illustrated in the [Width Properties Comparison Sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/WPF-Samples/tree/master/Elements/WidthProperties).

### DockPanel

The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> element uses the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> attached property as set in child content elements to position content along the edges of a container. When <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Dock.Top> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Dock.Bottom>, it positions child elements above or below each other. When <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.Dock%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Dock.Left> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Dock.Right>, it positions child elements to the left or right of each other. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.LastChildFill%2A> property determines the position of the final element added as a child of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>.

You can use <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> to position a group of related controls, such as a set of buttons. Alternately, you can use it to create a "paned" UI, similar to that found in Microsoft Outlook.

#### Sizing to content

If its <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> properties aren't specified, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> sizes to its content. The size can increase or decrease to accommodate the size of its child elements. However, when these properties are specified and there's no longer room for the next specified child element, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> doesn't display that child element or subsequent child elements and doesn't measure subsequent child elements.

#### LastChildFill

By default, the last child of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> element will "fill" the remaining, unallocated space. If this behavior isn't desired, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel.LastChildFill%2A> property to `false`.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to absolutely position content. This code produces three 100-pixel squares. The first square is red, and its top-left (*x, y*) position is specified as (0, 0). The second square is green, and its top-left position is (100, 100), just below and to the right of the first square. The third square is blue, and its top-left position is (50, 50), thus encompassing the lower-right quadrant of the first square and the upper-left quadrant of the second. Because the third square is laid out last, it appears to be on top of the other two squares—that is, the overlapping portions assume the color of the third box.

The compiled application yields a new UI that looks like this.

The following example demonstrates how to partition space using a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>. Five <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> elements are added as children of a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>. Each uses a different positioning property of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> to partition space. The final element "fills" the remaining, unallocated space.
