# x:Type Markup Extension

Supplies the CLR <xref:System.Type> object that is the underlying type for a specified XAML type.

## XAML Attribute Usage

```xaml
<object property="{x:Type prefix:typeNameValue}" .../>
```

## XAML Object Element Usage

```xaml
<x:Type TypeName="prefix:typeNameValue"/>
```

## XAML Values

|||
|-|-|
|`prefix`|Optional. A prefix that maps a non-default XAML namespace. Specifying a prefix is frequently not necessary. See Remarks.|
|`typeNameValue`|Required. A type name resolvable to the current default XAML namespace; or the specified mapped prefix if `prefix` is supplied.|

## Remarks

The `x:Type` markup extension has a similar function to the `typeof()` operator in C# or the `GetType` operator in Microsoft Visual Basic.

The `x:Type` markup extension supplies a from-string conversion behavior for properties that take the type <xref:System.Type>. The input is a XAML type. The relationship between the input XAML type and the output CLR <xref:System.Type> is that the output <xref:System.Type> is the <xref:System.Xaml.XamlType.UnderlyingType%2A> of the input <xref:System.Xaml.XamlType>, after looking up the necessary <xref:System.Xaml.XamlType> based on XAML schema context and the <xref:System.Windows.Markup.IXamlTypeResolver> service the context provides.

In .NET XAML Services, the handling for this markup extension is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Markup.TypeExtension> class.

In specific framework implementations, some properties that take <xref:System.Type> as a value can accept the name of the type directly (the string value of the type `Name`). However, implementing this behavior is a complex scenario. For examples, see the "WPF Usage Notes" section that follows.

Attribute syntax is the most common syntax used with this markup extension. The string token provided after the `x:Type` identifier string is assigned as the <xref:System.Windows.Markup.TypeExtension.TypeName%2A> value of the underlying <xref:System.Windows.Markup.TypeExtension> extension class. Under the default XAML schema context for .NET XAML Services, which is based on CLR types, the value of this attribute is either the <xref:System.Reflection.MemberInfo.Name%2A> of the desired type, or contains that <xref:System.Reflection.MemberInfo.Name%2A> preceded by a prefix for a non-default XAML namespace mapping.

The `x:Type` markup extension can be used in object element syntax. In this case, specifying the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Markup.TypeExtension.TypeName%2A> property is required to properly initialize the extension.

The `x:Type` markup extension can also be used as a verbose attribute; however this use is not typical: `<object property="{x:Type TypeName=typeNameValue}" .../>`

## WPF Usage Notes

### Default XAML Namespace and Type Mapping

The default XAML namespace for WPF programming contains most of the XAML types you need for typical XAML scenarios; therefore, you can often avoid prefixes when referencing XAML type values. You might need to map a prefix if you are referencing a type from a custom assembly or for types that exist in a WPF assembly but are from a CLR namespace that was not mapped to the default XAML namespace. For more information about prefixes, XAML namespaces, and mapping CLR namespaces, see [XAML Namespaces and Namespace Mapping for WPF XAML](../../framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-namespaces-and-namespace-mapping-for-wpf-xaml.md).

### Type Properties That Support Typename-as-String

WPF supports techniques that enable specifying the value of some properties of type <xref:System.Type> without requiring an `x:Type` markup extension usage. Instead, you can specify the value as a string that names the type. Examples of this are <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate.TargetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Style.TargetType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Support for this behavior is not provided through either type converters or markup extensions. Instead, this is a deferral behavior implemented through <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElementFactory>.

Silverlight supports a similar convention. In fact, Silverlight does not currently support `{x:Type}` in its XAML language support, and does not accept `{x:Type}` usages outside of a few circumstances that are intended to support WPF-Silverlight XAML migration. Therefore, the typename-as-string behavior is built-in to all Silverlight native property evaluation where a <xref:System.Type> is the value.

## XAML 2009

XAML 2009 provides additional support for generic types and modifies the feature behavior of `x:TypeArguments` and `x:Type` to provide this support.

- `x:TypeArguments` and the associated object element for a generic object instantiation can be on elements other than the root. For more information, see the "XAML 2009" section of [x:TypeArguments Directive](xtypearguments-directive.md).

- XAML 2009 supports a syntax for specifying a generic type's constraint in markup. This can be used by `x:TypeArguments`, by `x:Type`, or by the two features in combination.

- WPF XAML implementation when processing XAML 2009 for load also adds this capability to the implicit type conversion behavior for certain framework properties that use type <xref:System.Type>.

In WPF, you can use XAML 2009 features but only for loose XAML (XAML that is not markup-compiled). Markup-compiled XAML for WPF and the BAML form of XAML do not currently support the XAML 2009 keywords and features.
