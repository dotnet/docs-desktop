# xml:space Handling in XAML

The `xml:space` attribute is an XML-defined attribute that declares the significant white-space processing behavior within an object element. This behavior is relevant for all content (inner text) contained within the element where `xml:space` is declared, and also scopes to child elements.

## XAML Attribute Usage

```xaml
<object xml:space="preserve" />
```

 \- or -

```xaml
<object xml:space="default" />
```

## Remarks

The definition for the `xml:space` attribute in XAML including its two possible values is derived from `xml:space` as defined as a "special attribute" by W3C specifications for XML.

The default value of the `xml:space` attribute is the literal value `"default"`. For the value `"default"`, or if `xml:space` is not indicated at all, the behavior of significant white-space parsing is the default handling, as defined in the topic [White-space processing in XAML](white-space-processing.md).

To preserve white space within object element content, specify `xml:space="preserve"` on that object element.

Under most interpretations, the `xml:space` attribute effects and the value of the attribute are scoped to child elements.

For a complete discussion of white-space processing in XAML, see [White-space processing in XAML](white-space-processing.md).
