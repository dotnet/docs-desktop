# x:Class Directive
Configures XAML markup compilation to join partial classes between markup and code-behind. The code partial class is defined in a separate code file in a Common Language Specification (CLS) language, whereas the markup partial class is typically created by code generation during XAML compilation.

## XAML Attribute Usage

```xaml
<object x:Class="namespace.classname"...>
  ...
</object>
```

## XAML Values

|||
|-|-|
|`namespace`|Optional. Specifies a CLR namespace that contains the partial class identified by `classname`. If `namespace` is specified, a dot (.) separates `namespace` and `classname`. See Remarks.|
|`classname`|Required. Specifies the CLR name of the partial class that connects the loaded XAML and your code-behind for that XAML.|

## Dependencies

`x:Class` can only be specified on the root element of a XAML production. `x:Class` is invalid on any object that has a parent in the XAML production. For more information, see [\[MS-XAML\] Section 4.3.1.6](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff650760(v=pandp.10)).

## Remarks

The `namespace` value may contain additional dots to organize related namespaces into name hierarchies, which is a common technique in .NET programming. Only the last dot in a string of `x:Class` values is interpreted to separate `namespace` and `classname.` The class that is used as `x:Class` cannot be a nested class. Nested classes are not allowed because determining the meaning of dots for `x:Class` strings is ambiguous if nested classes are permitted.

In existing programming models that use `x:Class`, `x:Class` is optional in the sense that it is entirely valid to have a XAML page that has no code-behind. However, that capability interacts with the build actions as implemented by frameworks that use XAML. `x:Class` capability is also influenced by the roles that various classifications of XAML-specified content have in an application model and in the corresponding build actions. If your XAML declares event-handling attribute values or instantiates custom elements where the defining classes are in the code-behind class, you have to provide the `x:Class` directive reference (or [x:Subclass](xsubclass-directive.md)) to the appropriate class for code-behind.

The value of the `x:Class` directive must be a string that specifies the fully qualified name of a class but without any assembly information (equivalent to the <xref:System.Type.FullName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>). For simple applications, you can omit CLR namespace information if the code-behind is also structured in that manner (code definition starts at the class level).

The code-behind file for a page or application definition must be within a code file that is included as part of the project that produces a compiled application and involves markup compilation. You must follow name rules for CLR classes. For more information, see [Framework Design Guidelines](../../../api/index.md). By default, the code-behind class must be `public`; however, you can define it at a different access level by using the [x:ClassModifier Directive](xclassmodifier-directive.md).

This interpretation of the `x:Class` attribute applies only to a CLR-based XAML implementation, in particular to .NET XAML Services. Other XAML implementations that are not based on CLR and that do not use .NET XAML Services might use a different resolution formula for connecting XAML markup and backing run-time code. For more information about more general interpretations of `x:Class`, see [\[MS-XAML\]](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff650760(v=pandp.10)).

At a certain level of architecture, the meaning of `x:Class` is undefined in .NET XAML Services. This is because .NET XAML Services does not specify the programming model by which XAML markup and backing code are connected. Additional uses of the `x:Class` directive might be implemented by specific frameworks that use programming models or application models to define how to connect XAML markup and CLR-based code-behind. Each framework can have its own build actions that enable some of the behavior or specific components that must be included in the build environment. Within a framework, build actions can also vary depending on the specific CLR language that is used for the code-behind.

## x:Class in the WPF Programming Model

In WPF applications and the WPF application model, `x:Class` can be declared as an attribute for any element that is the root of a XAML file and is being compiled (where the XAML is included in a WPF application project with `Page` build action), or for the <xref:System.Windows.Application> root in the application definition of a compiled WPF application. Declaring `x:Class` on an element other than a page root or application root, or on a WPF XAML file that is not compiled, causes a compile-time error under the .NET Framework 3.0 and .NET Framework 3.5 WPF XAML compiler. For information about other aspects of `x:Class` handling in WPF, see [Code-Behind and XAML in WPF](../../framework/wpf/advanced/code-behind-and-xaml-in-wpf.md).

## x:Class for Windows Workflow Foundation
For Windows Workflow Foundation, `x:Class` names the class of a custom activity composed entirely in XAML, or names the partial class of the XAML page for  an activity designer with code-behind.

## Silverlight Usage Notes

`x:Class` for Silverlight is documented separately. For more information, see [XAML Namespace (x:) Language Features (Silverlight)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/silverlight/dotnet-windows-silverlight/cc188995(v=vs.95)).
