# What's new in WPF for .NET 10 Preview

This article describes what's new in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for .NET 10 Preview.

## Preview 2

.NET 10 Preview 2 was released on March 18, 2025.

### Performance improvements

Performance was improved by replacing internal data structures with base .NET types, such as <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection`1>. This minimized allocations in UI automation and file dialogs, and speeding up pixel format conversions.

### Bug fixes

Addressed various bug fixes including UI element cursor types, crash issues when bitmap streams are null, build and test step errors, and minor bugs in <xref:System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapMetadata> and native dependencies.

Updated WPF's implementation of the Fluent UI style, which is still in progress. Here are some of the improvements:

- Default style for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label>.
- Fixed the animation for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander>.

Addressed localization issues for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContextMenu>.

## Preview 1

.NET 10 Preview 1 was released on February 25, 2025.

For WPF, this release only included a few minor patches and bug fixes. Key areas are:

- Over 4,000 unit tests for `System.Xaml` and `WindowsBase` added.
- Fluent Theme issue fixes, including a **HighContrast** crash.
- Cleanup of CAS (Code Access Security) attributes.
  - Remove unused CAS resource strings and its translations from all libraries.
  - Remove unused CAS and XBAP code from `OleCmdHelper/ISecureCommand`.
  - Remove unused CAS code from `FontSourceCollection/FontSource`.
