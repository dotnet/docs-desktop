# How to handle keyboard input messages in the form (Windows Forms .NET)

Windows Forms provides the ability to handle keyboard messages at the form level, before the messages reach a control. This article shows how to accomplish this task.

## Handle a keyboard message

Handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event of the active form and set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.KeyPreview%2A> property of the form to `true`. This property causes the keyboard to be received by the form before they reach any controls on the form. The following code example handles the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event by detecting all of the number keys and consuming <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>, and <kbd>7</kbd>.
