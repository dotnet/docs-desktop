# Compiler Warning WFO1001

**Version introduced:** .NET 10 Preview 2

> `Type` type does not implement `ITypedDataObject`.

`ITypedDataObject` is an interface introduced in .NET 10. It provides typed data conversion for use with the clipboard and drag-and-drop operations.

## To correct this warning

Implement `ITypedDataObject` instead of `IDataObject`.

## Manage the warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorConfig_ file.

  ```ini
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.WFO1001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);WFO1001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable WFO1001` directive.
