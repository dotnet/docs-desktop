# Compiler Warning WFO0001

**Version introduced:** .NET 9

> Only projects with `OutputType=WindowsApplication` supported.

Only projects with `OutputType` set to `Exe` or `WinExe` are supported, because only application projects define an application entry point, where the application bootstrap code must reside.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with .NET 9, this warning has changed to [WFO0001](../compiler-messages/wfo0001.md).

## To correct this warning

Remove the call to `ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize` or change the project type to an executable.
