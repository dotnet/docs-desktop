# PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)

The Windows Forms [PrintDialog](../../../framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications. Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a selected page range, or print a selection. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class.

## Working with the Component

Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box at run time. This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class). Either of these, in turn, may be shared by multiple printers.

When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer in Visual Studio.

## How to: Capture User Input from a PrintDialog at Run Time

While you can set options related to printing at design time, you will sometimes want to change these options at run time, most likely because of choices made by the user. You can capture user input for printing a document using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> and the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> components.  
  
### To change print options programmatically  
  
1. Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> and a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  
  
1. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog.Document%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> to the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> added to the form.  
  
    ```vb  
    PrintDialog1.Document = PrintDocument1  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    printDialog1.Document = PrintDocument1;  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    printDialog1->Document = PrintDocument1;  
    ```  
  
1. Display the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method.  
  
    ```vb  
    PrintDialog1.ShowDialog()  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    printDialog1.ShowDialog();  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    printDialog1->ShowDialog();  
    ```  
  
1. The user's printing choices from the dialog will be copied to the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  

## How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs

The foundation of printing in Windows Forms is the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> componentâ€”more specifically, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event. By writing code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event, you can specify what to print and how to print it.  
  
### To create a print job  
  
1. Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  
  
2. Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  
  
     You will have to code your own printing logic. Additionally, you will have to specify the material to be printed.  
  
     In the following code example, a sample graphic in the shape of a red rectangle is created in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler to act as material to be printed.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  
       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500))  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,
    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  
    {  
       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red,
         new Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  
          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  
       {  
          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Red,  
             Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  
       }  
    ```  
  
     (Visual C# and Visual C++) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  
  
    ```csharp  
    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  
       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  
       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  
       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  
       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  
    ```  
  
     You may also want to write code for the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.BeginPrint> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> events, perhaps including an integer representing the total number of pages to print that is decremented as each page prints.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component to your form to provide a clean and efficient user interface (UI) to your users. Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog.Document%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component enables you to set properties related to the print document you're working with on your form. For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component, see [PrintDialog Component](../controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md).  
  
     For more information about the specifics of Windows Forms print jobs, including how to create a print job programmatically, see <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs>.  
  
## How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs

Frequently, word processors and other applications that involve printing will provide the option to display a message to users that a print job is complete. You can provide this functionality in your Windows Forms by handling the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  
  
 The following procedure requires that you have created a Windows-based application with a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component on it, which is the standard way of enabling printing from a Windows-based application. For more information about printing from Windows Forms using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md).  
  
### To complete a print job  
  
1. Set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  
  
    ```vb  
    PrintDocument1.DocumentName = "MyTextFile"  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    printDocument1.DocumentName = "MyTextFile";  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    printDocument1->DocumentName = "MyTextFile";  
    ```  
  
1. Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event.  
  
     In the following code example, a message box is displayed, indicating that the document has finished printing.  
  
    ```vb  
    Private Sub PrintDocument1_EndPrint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.EndPrint  
       MessageBox.Show(PrintDocument1.DocumentName + " has finished printing.")  
    End Sub  
    ```  
  
    ```csharp  
    private void printDocument1_EndPrint(object sender,
    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs e)  
    {  
       MessageBox.Show(printDocument1.DocumentName +
          " has finished printing.");  
    }  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    private:  
       void printDocument1_EndPrint(System::Object ^ sender,  
          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventArgs ^ e)  
       {  
          MessageBox::Show(String::Concat(printDocument1->DocumentName,  
             " has finished printing."));  
       }  
    ```  
  
     (Visual C# and Visual C++) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  
  
    ```csharp  
    this.printDocument1.EndPrint += new  
       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventHandler  
       (this.printDocument1_EndPrint);  
    ```  
  
    ```cpp  
    this->printDocument1->EndPrint += gcnew  
       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventHandler  
       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_EndPrint);  
    ```
