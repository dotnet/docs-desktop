# Add a control (Windows Forms .NET)

Most forms are designed by adding controls to the surface of the form to define a user interface (UI). A *control* is a component on a form used to display information or accept user input.<!-- TODO For more information about controls, see [Forms overview](..\forms\overview.md). -->

The primary way a control is added to a form is through the Visual Studio Designer, but you can also manage the controls on a form at run time through code.

## Add with Designer

Visual Studio uses the Forms Designer to design forms. There is a Controls pane which lists all the controls available to your app. You can add controls from the pane in two ways:

### Add the control by double-clicking

When a control is double-clicked, it is automatically added to the current open form with default settings.

### Add the control by drawing

Select the control by clicking on it. In your form, drag-select a region. The control will be placed to fit the size of the region you selected.

## Add with code

Controls can be created and then added to a form at run time with the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> collection. This collection can also be used to remove controls from a form.

The following code adds and positions two controls, a [Label](xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label) and a [TextBox](xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox):
