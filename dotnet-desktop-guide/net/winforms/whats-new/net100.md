# What's new in Windows Forms for .NET 10 Preview

This article describes what's new in Windows Forms for .NET 10 Preview 1.

## Preview 1

.NET 10 Preview 1 was released on February 20, 2025.

The main improvement in WinForms for .NET 10 Preview 1 was changes to clipboard serialization and deserialization.

### Clipboard changes

.NET 9 obsoleted `BinaryFormatter`, which is used in some clipboard operations. These clipboard operations required you to opt in to compatibility package, or work around the operation. To ease the pain of moving away from `BinaryFormatter`, .NET 10 is obsoleting certain clipboard methods to indicate that they shouldn't be used. More methods are being added to help JSON serialization with clipboard data, circumventing the need for `BinaryFormatter`.
