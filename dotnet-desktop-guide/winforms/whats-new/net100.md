# What's new in Windows Forms for .NET 10 Preview

This article provides a high-level overview about what's new with Windows Forms (WinForms) in .NET 10 Preview. For detailed information, see the [release announcements](#release-announcements).

.NET 10 Preview 7 was released in August 2025.

## Clipboard changes

Windows Forms is shipping new code for the clipboard API. The clipboard is redesigned in a way that its code can be shared with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Both desktop technologies now share the same code and unify how they interact with the clipboard.

.NET 9 obsoleted `BinaryFormatter`, which is used in some clipboard operations. These clipboard operations required you to opt in to compatibility package, or work around the operation. To ease the pain of moving away from `BinaryFormatter`, .NET 10 is obsoleting certain clipboard methods to indicate that they shouldn't be used. More methods are being added to help JSON serialization with clipboard data, circumventing the need for `BinaryFormatter`.

## Custom designer improvements

Several <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor> types have been ported from .NET Framework, including `ToolStripCollectionEditor` and several editors related to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. These editors are now discoverable by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> and the Windows Forms Designer Actions panel.

SnapLines were fixed for custom designers.

## Dark mode

Windows Forms for .NET 9 introduced preliminary dark mode visual styling, with the goal of completing impelmentation in .NET 10.

- `ListView` column headers are now working.
- `StatusStrip` and `ToolStrip` render correctly.
- Buttons with `FlatStyle` set to `Standard` also render correctly.
- `ComboBox` and `RichTextBox` now render correctly when disabled.

  However, `RichTextBox` has a rendering issue when it's disabled. If the `RichTextBox` has formatted content, only the first few visible lines appear correctly, and the formatting might not fully apply in the disabled state. To workaround this issue, set it to  read-only and manually disable selections.

- `PropertyGrid` special buttons (ellipsis and drop-down) now render consistently in dark mode.

- Many other fixes for color issues with dark mode.

## Bug fixes

Here are some of the bugs fixed in Windows Forms for .NET 10:

- If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> was in edit mode while the hosting dialog was closed, it would throw `InvalidOperationException`. The bug causing this has been fixed.
- [Compiler Error WFO1000](../compiler-messages/wfo1000.md) has been improved to reduce false positives related to interfaces that derive from `IComponent`.
- Fixed a regression with `PrinterSettings.DefaultPageSettings.Color` returning an incorrect value.
- Resolving a memory leak in the **MSHTML** component.

## Accessibility

Improved NVDA screen reader support.

## Code cleanup

Removed deprecated .NET runtime and unnecessary package references. Code style has been cleaned up to address warnings and improve code quality.

## ScreenCaptureMode API

A new API has been introduced to prevent screen capture applications (that use the Windows API) from capturing a form. This feature is useful to protect sensitive information, such as user names, user IDs, or passwords, from being leaked.

The `Form.ScreenCaptureMode` is set to one of the following values to control capture behavior:

- `Allow`&mdash;(Default) Allows the form to be captured.
- `HideContent`&mdash;The form appears blacked out when captured.
- `HideWindow`&mdash;Blurs the form when captured. (Requires Windows 10 20H1 version 2004 or higher.)

## Analyzer improvements

Existing analyzers have been fine-tuned to reduce false positives.

New analyzers have been added:

- [Warning WFDEV004 - `Form.OnClosing`, `Form.OnClosed` and the corresponding events are obsolete.](../wfdev-diagnostics/wfdev004.md)
- [Warning WFDEV005 - `GetData` methods are obsolete. Use `TryGetData<T>` methods instead.](../wfdev-diagnostics/wfdev005.md)
- [Warning WFDEV006 - Some controls are obsolete. They're provided for binary compatibility with .NET Framework.](../wfdev-diagnostics/wfdev006.md)
