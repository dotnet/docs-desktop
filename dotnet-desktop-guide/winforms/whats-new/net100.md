# What's new in Windows Forms for .NET 10 Preview

## Clipboard changes

Windows Forms is shipping new code for the clipboard API. The clipboard is redesigned in a way that its code can be shared with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Both desktop technologies will eventually share the same code and unify how they interact with the clipboard.

.NET 9 obsoleted `BinaryFormatter`, which is used in some clipboard operations. These clipboard operations required you to opt in to compatibility package, or work around the operation. To ease the pain of moving away from `BinaryFormatter`, .NET 10 is obsoleting certain clipboard methods to indicate that they shouldn't be used. More methods are being added to help JSON serialization with clipboard data, circumventing the need for `BinaryFormatter`.

## Custom designer improvements

Several <xref:System.Drawing.Design.UITypeEditor> types have been ported from .NET Framework, including `ToolStripCollectionEditor` and several editors related to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. These editors are now discoverable by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> and the Windows Forms Designer Actions panel.

## Accessability

Improved NVDA screen reader support.
