# Compiler Warning WFO0001

**Version introduced:** .NET 9

> Only projects with `OutputType=WindowsApplication` supported.

Only projects with `OutputType` set to `Exe` or `WinExe` are supported, because only application projects define an application entry point, where the application bootstrap code must reside.

## To correct this warning

Remove the call to `ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize` or change the project type to an executable.

  dotnet_diagnostic.WFO0001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).
