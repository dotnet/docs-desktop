# How to set the tab order on Windows Forms

The tab order is the order in which a user moves focus from one control to another by pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. Each form has its own tab order. By default, the tab order is the same as the order in which you created the controls. Tab-order numbering begins with zero and ascends in value, and is set with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> property.

You can also set the tab order directly by using the [designer's Property window](#designer) or with [Tab Order mode](#use-tab-order-mode).

Tab order can be set in the **Properties** window of the designer using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> property. The `TabIndex` property of a control determines where it's positioned in the tab order. By default, the first control added to the designer has a `TabIndex` value of 0, the second has a `TabIndex` of 1, and so on. Once the highest `TabIndex` has been focused, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> focuses the control with the lowest `TabIndex` value.

Container controls, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, treat their children as separate from the rest of the form. Each child in the container has its own <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> value. Because a container control can't be focused, when the tab order reaches the container control, the child control of the container with the lowest `TabIndex` is focused. As the <kbd>Tab</kbd> is pressed, each child control is focused according to its `TabIndex` value until the last control. When <kbd>Tab</kbd> is pressed on the last control, focus resumes to the next control in the parent of the container, based on the next `TabIndex` value.

Any control on your form can be skipped in the tab order by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop%2A> property false.

## Designer

Use the Visual Studio **Properties** window to set the tab order of a control.

01. Select the control in the designer.

01. In the **Properties** window in Visual Studio, set the `TabIndex` property of the control to an appropriate number.

## Programmatic

The tab order of controls can be set through code:

01. Set the `TabIndex` property to a numerical value.

    ```vb
    Button1.TabIndex = 1
    ```

    ```csharp
    Button1.TabIndex = 1;
    ```

## Use Tab Order mode

Visual Studio's Visual Designer provides an interactive way to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> property for controls. The **Tab Order** mode allows you to sequentially set the tab order of controls by clicking on them in the Visual Designer.

01. In Visual Studio, on the **View** menu, select **Tab Order**.

    This activates the tab-order selection mode on the form. A number (representing the `TabIndex` property) appears in the upper-left corner of each control.

01. Click the controls sequentially to establish the tab order you want.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A control's place within the tab order can be set to any value greater than or equal to 0. When duplicates occur, the z-order of the two controls is evaluated and the control on top is tabbed to first. (The z-order is the visual layering of controls on a form along the form's z-axis [depth]. The z-order determines which controls are in front of other controls.) For more information on z-order, see [Layering Objects on Windows Forms](how-to-layer-objects-on-windows-forms.md).

01. To finish, select **View** > **Tab Order** again.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Controls that can't be focused, such as disabled and invisible controls, aren't included in the tab order. As a user presses the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, these controls are skipped.

## Remove a control from the tab order

You can prevent a control from receiving focus when the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key is pressed, by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop%2A> property to `false`. The control is skipped when you cycle through the controls with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. The control doesn't lose its tab order when this property is set to `false`.

> [!NOTE]
> A radio button group has a single tab stop at run-time. The selected button, the button with its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton.Checked%2A> property set to `true`, has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop%2A> property automatically set to `true`. Other buttons in the radio button group have their `TabStop` property set to `false`.<!-- LINK For more information about grouping <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls, see [Grouping Windows Forms RadioButton Controls to Function as a Set](how-to-group-windows-forms-radiobutton-controls-to-function-as-a-set.md). -->

### Set TabStop with the designer

01. Select the control in the designer.

01. In the **Properties** window in Visual Studio, set the **TabStop** property to `False`.

### Set TabStop programmatically

01. Set the `TabStop` property to `false`.

    ```csharp
    Button1.TabStop = false;
    ```

    ```vb
    Button1.TabStop = False
    ```
