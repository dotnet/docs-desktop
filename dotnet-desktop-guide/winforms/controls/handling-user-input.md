# Handling User Input

This topic describes the main keyboard and mouse events provided by <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control?displayProperty=nameWithType>. When handling an event, control authors should override the protected `On`*EventName* method rather than attaching a delegate to the event. For a review of events, see [Raising Events from a Component](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/sh2e3k5z(v=vs.120)).

> [!NOTE]
> If there is no data associated with an event, an instance of the base class <xref:System.EventArgs> is passed as an argument to the `On`*EventName* method.

## Keyboard Events

The common keyboard events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp>.

|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
|`KeyDown`|`void OnKeyDown(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised only when a key is initially pressed.|
|`KeyPress`|`void OnKeyPress`<br /><br /> `(KeyPressEventArgs)`|Raised every time a key is pressed. If a key is held down, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event is raised at the repeat rate defined by the operating system.|
|`KeyUp`|`void OnKeyUp(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised when a key is released.|

> [!NOTE]
> Handling keyboard input is considerably more complex than overriding the events in the preceding table and is beyond the scope of this topic. For more information, see [Overview of using the keyboard](../input-keyboard/overview.md).

## Mouse Events

The mouse events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseHover>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseLeave>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseUp>. For more information, see [Overview of using the mouse](../input-mouse/overview.md).

|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
|`MouseDown`|`void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is pressed while the pointer is over the control.|
|`MouseEnter`|`void OnMouseEnter(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer first enters the region of the control.|
|`MouseHover`|`void OnMouseHover(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer hovers over the control.|
|`MouseLeave`|`void OnMouseLeave(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer leaves the region of the control.|
|`MouseMove`|`void OnMouseMove(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer moves in the region of the control.|
|`MouseUp`|`void OnMouseUp(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is released while the pointer is over the control or the pointer leaves the region of the control.|
